## What I Think "I Statements" Are For

Attendees of peer support groups and corporate sensitivity trainings are often directed to speak in ["I statements"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-message): you're supposed to talk about your _own_ feelings and perceptions.

[TODO: give examples https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/i-message]
[TODO: but it's not obviously retarded in the therapy context (because other people have access to introspective data that you don't); being up example of this being applied inappropriately to me at WTF group?â€”or /r/rational example?]

If you're like me, your first reaction is probably to think that this is _retarded_. Forcing everyone to only make narcissistic claims about their map, and not make any claims about the territory (which could be construed to call other people's maps into question and thereby threaten their egos, because [disagreement is disrespect](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/09/disagreement-is.html)) is great for reducing social conflict.

[TODO: reducing conflict is not retarded when you're trying to not get sidetracked when building a shared map. If I try to directly add my belief to the shared map, then everyone who disagrees has an incentive to fight about right then and there. But if I "quote" it, wrap it in an "I think" to indicate that other people disagree, that's something people don't have an incentive to fight about, the I-wrapped statement can be added to the map without getting bogged down in a fight]
