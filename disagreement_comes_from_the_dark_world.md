# Disagreement Comes From the Dark World

In ["Truth or Dare"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TQ4AXj3bCMfrNPTLf/truth-or-dare), Duncan Sabien articulates a pattern in which expectations of good or bad behavior can become self-fulfilling: people who expect to be exploited and feel the need to put up defenses both elicit and get sorted into situations where exploitation is likely and defenses are necessary, whereas people who expect beneficience tend to attract beneficience in turn.

Among many other examples, Sabien highlights the phenomenon of gift economies: a high-trust culture in which everyone is eager to help each other out whenever they can is a nicer place to live than a low-trust culture in which every transaction must be carefully tracked for fear of enabling free-riders.

I am somewhat skeptical of the extent to which Sabien seems to suggest that differences between high- and low-trust cultures can be explained by self-fulfilling expectations as opposed to pre-existing differences in trust-_worthiness_, but I do grant that self-fulfilling expectations can sometimes play a role: if I insist on being paid back immediately and in full, it makes sense that that would impede the development of a gift-economy culture in the social graph adjacent to me. So far, the theory articulated in the essay seems broadly plausible.

Later, however, the post takes an unexpected turn:

Zack Davis does not understand how high-trust, high-cooperation dynamics work. He has never seen them. They are utterly outside of his experience and beyond his comprehension. What he knows how to do is keep his footing in a world of liars and thieves and pickpockets, and he does this with genuinely admirable skill and inexhaustible tenacity.

As a reader of the essay, I reply: wait, who? Am I supposed to know who this Davies person is? Ctrl-F confirms that they weren't mentioned earlier in the piece; there's no reason for me to have any context for whatever this section is about.

As Zack Davis, however, I have a more specific reply, which is: yeah, I don't think that button does what you think it does. Let me explain.

In figuring out what would constitute good conduct and productive discourse, it's important to appreciate how bizarre the human practice of "discourse" looks in light of [Aumann's dangerous idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aumann%27s_agreement_theorem).

[There's only one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRd6oF-vBQg) reality. If I'm a Bayesian reasoner honestly reporting my beliefs about some question, and you're also a Bayesian reasoner honestly reporting your beliefs about the same question, we should converge on the same answer, not because we're cooperating with each other, but because it _is_ the answer. When I update my beliefs based on your report on your beliefs, it's strictly because I expect your report to be [evidentially entangled](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6s3xABaXKPdFwA3FS/what-is-evidence) with the answer. Maybe that's a kind of "trust", but if so, it's in the same sense in which I "trust" that [an increase in atmospheric pressure will exert force on the exposed basin of a classical barometer and push more mercury up the reading tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer#Mercury_barometers). It's not personal and it's not reciprocal: the barometer and I aren't doing each other any favors. What would that even mean?

In contrast, my friends and I in a gift economy _are_ doing each other favors. That kind of setting featuring agents with a mixture of shared and conflicting interests is the context in which the concepts of "cooperation" and "defection" and reciprocal "trust" (in the sense of people trusting each other, rather than a Bayesian robot trusting a barometer) make sense. If everyone pitches in with chores when they can, we all get the benefits of the chores being done—that's cooperation. If you never wash the dishes, you're getting the benefits of a clean kitchen without paying the costs—that's defection. If I retaliate by refusing to wash any dishes myself, then we both suffer a dirty kitchen, but at least I'm not being exploited—that's mutual defection. If we institute a chore wheel with an auditing regime, that reëstablishes cooperation, but we're paying higher transaction costs for our lack of mutual trust. And so on: Sabien's essay does a good job of explaining how there can be more than one possible equilibrium in this kind of system, some of which are much more pleasant than others.

If you've seen high-trust gift-economy-like cultures working well and low-trust backstabby cultures working poorly, it might be tempting to generalize from the domains of interpersonal or economic relationships, to rational (or even ["rationalist"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SX6wQEdGfzz7GKYvp/rationalist-discourse-is-like-physicist-motors)) discourse. If trust and cooperation are essential for living and working together, shouldn't the same lessons apply straightforwardly to finding out what's true together?

The problem is that the payoff matrices are different.

Life and work involve a mixture of shared and conflicting interests. The existence of some conflicting interests is an essential part of what it means for you and me to be two different agents rather than interchangable parts of the same hivemind: we should hope to do well together, but when push comes to shove, I care more about me doing well than you doing well. The art of cooperation is about maintaining the conditions such that push does not in fact come to shove.

But truthseeking does not involve conflicting interests. There's only one reality. Bayesian reasoners cannot agree to disagree. Accordingly, when humans successfully approach the Bayesian ideal, it doesn't particularly feel like cooperating with your beloved friends, who see you with all your blemishes and imperfections but would never let a mere disagreement interfere with loving you. It feels like just seeing things—[resolving disagreements so quickly that you don't even notice them as disagreements](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4S6zunFNFY3f5JYxt/aumann-agreement-is-common). It feels like math.

Suppose you and I have just arrived at a bus stop for a bus that arrives about every half-hour. I don't know when the last bus was, so I don't know when the next bus will be: I assign a uniform probability distribution over the next thirty minutes. You recently looked at the published bus schedule, which says the bus will come in six minutes: most of your probability-mass is concentrated tightly around six minutes from now.

This is a disagreement: you and I don't have the same the same probability distribution. It's also very ephemeral: when I ask, "When do you think the bus will come?" and you say, "Six minutes according to the schedule that I just checked", I immediately replace my belief with yours, because I think the published schedule is probably right and there's no particular reason for you to lie about what it says.

Alternatively, suppose that we both checked different versions of the schedule, which disagree: the schedule I looked at said the next bus is in twenty minutes, not six. When we discover the discrepancy, we infer that one of the schedules must have been outdated, and both adopt a probability distribution with clusters around six and twenty minutes from now. Our initial beliefs can't both have been right—but there's no reason for me to weight my prior belief more heavily just because it was mine.

The case of rapid updating about the next bus arrival is presumably not what Sabien means by "high-trust, high-cooperation dynamics" that I "[have] never seen" and are "utterly outside of [my] experience and beyond [my] comprehension", because I just told you about it.
