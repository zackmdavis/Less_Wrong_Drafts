## Conflict Theory of Bounded Distrust

Scott Alexander [once wrote about the difference between](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/24/conflict-vs-mistake/) "mistake theorists" who treat politics as an engineering discipline (a symmetrical collaboration in which everyone ultimately just wants [the best ideas to win](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/)) and "conflict theorists" who treat politics as war (an asymmetrical conflict between sides with fundamentally different interests). Crucially, "[m]istake theorists naturally think conflict theorists are _making a mistake_"; "[c]onflict theorists naturally think mistake theorists are _the enemy in their conflict_."

More recently, Alexander [considered the phenomenon of "bounded distrust"](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/bounded-distrust): science and media authorities aren't completely honest, but are only willing to bend the truth so far, and can be trusted on the things they wouldn't lie about. Fox News wants to fuel xenophobia, but they wouldn't make up a terrorist attack out of whole cloth; liberal academics want to combat xenophobia, but they wouldn't outright fabricate crime statistics.

Alexander explains that savvy people who can figure out what kinds of dishonesty an authority will engage in, end up mostly trusting the authority, whereas clueless people become more distrustful. _Sufficiently_ savvy people end up inhabiting a mental universe where the authority _is_ trustworthy, as when Dan Quayle denied that characterizing tax increases as "revenue enhancements" constituted fooling the publicâ€”because "no one was fooled".

Alexander concludes with a characteristicly mistake-theoretic plea for mutual understanding:

> The savvy people need to realize that the clueless people aren't _always_ paranoid, just less experienced than they are at dealing with a hostile environment that lies to them all the time.
>
> And the clueless people need to realize that the savvy people aren't _always_ gullible, just more optimistic about their ability to extract signal from same.
