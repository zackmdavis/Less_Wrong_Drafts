# On the Normativity of Debate: A Discussion With Said Achmiz

(The top post in this thread quotes and summarizes discussion that occurred elsewhere.)

Said Achmiz, citing Arthur Schopenhauer's _The Art of Controversy_, [argues that debaters encountering an apparently crushing counterargument should not immediately concede](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ExssKjAaXEEYcnzPd/conversational-cultures-combat-vs-nurture-v2?commentId=4qJk3BZ2oQtFskYLh):

> Schopenhauer comments on people's vanity, irrationality, stubbornness, and tendency toward rationalization:
>
>> If human nature were not base, but thoroughly honourable, we should in every debate have no other aim than the discovery of truth; we should not in the least care whether the truth proved to be in favour of the opinion which we had begun by expressing, or of the opinion of our adversary. That we should regard as a matter of no moment, or, at any rate, of very secondary consequence; but, as things are, it is the main concern. Our innate vanity, which is particularly sensitive in reference to our intellectual powers, will not suffer us to allow that our first position was wrong and our adversary's right. The way out of this difficulty would be simply to take the trouble always to form a correct judgment. For this a man would have to think before he spoke. But, with most men, innate vanity is accompanied by loquacity and innate dishonesty. They speak before they think; and even though they may afterwards perceive that they are wrong, and that what they assert is false, they want it to seem the contrary. The interest in truth, which may be presumed to have been their only motive when they stated the proposition alleged to be true, now gives way to the interests of vanity: and so, for the sake of vanity, what is true must seem false, and what is false must seem true.

>> However, this very dishonesty, this persistence in a proposition which seems false even to ourselves, has something to be said for it. It often happens that we begin with the firm conviction of the truth of our statement; but our opponent's argument appears to refute it. Should we abandon our position at once, we may discover later on that we were right after all: the proof we offered was false, but nevertheless there was a proof for our statement which was true. The argument which would have been our salvation did not occur to us at the moment. Hence we make it a rule to attack a counter-argument, even though to all appearances it is true and forcible, in the belief that its truth is only superficial, and that in the course of the dispute another argument will occur to us by which we may upset it, or succeed in confirming the truth of our statement. In this way we are almost compelled to become dishonest; or, at any rate, the temptation to do so is very great. **Thus it is that the weakness of our intellect and the perversity of our will lend each other mutual support**; and that, generally, a disputant fights not for truth, but for his proposition, as though it were a battle _pro aris et focis_. He sets to work _per fas et nefas_; nay, as we have seen, he cannot easily do otherwise. As a rule, then, every man will insist on maintaining whatever he has said, even though for the moment he may consider it false or doubtful.

So if we _immediately_ admit that our interlocutor is right and we are wrong, as soon as this seems to be the case, then we can very easily be led into error!

>> In following out the rules to this end, no respect should be paid to objective truth, because we usually do not know where the truth lies. As I have said, a man often does not himself know whether he is in the right or not; he often believes it, and is mistaken: both sides often believe it. Truth is in the depths. At the beginning of a contest each man believes, as a rule, that right is on his side; in the course of it, both become doubtful, and the truth is not determined or confirmed until the close.

>
> So let us not demand—neither of our interlocutors, nor of ourselves—that a compelling argument be _immediately_ accepted. It may well be that stubborn defense of one's starting position—combined with a willingness to reflect, after the dispute ends, and to change one's mind later—is a better path to truth.

Achmiz would later [describe the behavior of being unwilling to budge to counterarguments as "normatively correct"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rzFrwWvvpgzfnwSeB/some-basic-level-of-mutual-respect-about-whether-other?commentId=h3wBt5fGuQmbf3KGH).

I [opined](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/98sCTsGJZ77WgQ6nE/banning-said-achmiz-and-broader-thoughts-on-moderation?commentId=MFCSsLjwiAEi7jSni) [that](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/98sCTsGJZ77WgQ6nE/banning-said-achmiz-and-broader-thoughts-on-moderation?commentId=EGiBoztCQBAfbYZsY) while I agree that it's possible to concede an argument too early and that good outcomes often result from being obstinate in the heat on an argument and reflecting at leisure later, I think describing obstinancy as "normatively correct" is taking it way too far.

In discussions of rationality, I usually take the word _normative_—[of or relating to](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/normative) [an authoritative standard](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/norm)—to refer to the authoritative standard of ideal Bayesian reasoning, often in contrast to what humans do. As Schopenhauer observes, the entire concept of adversarial debate is non-normative in this sense! [Aumann's agreement theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aumann%27s_agreement_theorem) is a mathematical expression of Schopenhauer's dictum that "we should not in the least care whether the truth proved to be in favor of the opinion which we had begun by expressing, or of the opinion of our adversary." And yet people do.

Achmiz [replied](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/98sCTsGJZ77WgQ6nE/banning-said-achmiz-and-broader-thoughts-on-moderation?commentId=gXnu2qzQWg3zXxWRM):

> Indeed, so either we take this to mean that _any_ normative claims about how to conduct such debates are necessarily meaningless, or else we allow for a concept of normativity that is not restricted to idealized Bayesian reasoners (which, I must remind you, are not actually real things that exist). Now, I am not saying that we should not identify an ideal and try to approach it asymptotically, but surely it makes no sense to behave as if we have _already_ reached that ideal. And until we have (which seems unlikely to happen anytime soon or possibly ever), adversarial debate is a form of epistemic inquiry we will always have with us. So there must be right and wrong ways to go about doing it.

(And now, the continuation—)

I reply:

I emphatically agree that as long as there's a recognizably human "we", we will always have adversarial debate with us. Attempts to deny or disparage the necessity of debate in favor of some pipe dream of "collaborative truthseeking" have been and will continue to be a disastrous farce, like communism.

Nevertheless, when I consider why debate works, I don't want to use the word "normative" to describe the behavior of the obstinate debater, even while [recognizing how the behavior plays a functional role within a larger system that discovers truths under the laws of normative reasoning](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SX6wQEdGfzz7GKYvp/rationalist-discourse-is-like-physicist-motors).

In order to evaluate the truth of a proposition, [a cognitive system must evaluate the evidence (or arguments) for and against it](https://www.readthesequences.com/The-Scales-Of-Justice-The-Notebook-Of-Rationality). It turns out that humans are particularly adept at rationalization, latching on to a proposition that we _want_ to be true (respectively false), and searching hard for arguments for (respectively against) it. As a result, it turns out to be incredibly productive to pit the efforts of a human who wants the proposition to be true against the efforts of another human who wants the proposition to be false. Driven by vanity to maintain whatever they have said, the disputants will thoroughly explore the space of arguments concerning the proposition, and each painstakingly correct his adversary's errors—probably more thoroughly and more painstakingly than if they were merely curious about the proposition.

Debate works—more than anything else. As long as people are human, it could hardly be otherwise. To simply declare that "we should in every debate have no other aim than the discovery of truth" is about as actionable as delcaring that the economy should function "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need"—[and with similar results](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vfjptEJ2oahLqRyZz/justice-cherryl).

And yet, all this having been said acknowledging that the success of adversarial debate has deep roots in human nature, I think it's important to notice the ways in which human nature is normatively silly. Yeah, okay, I see how it is "that the weakness of our intellect and the perversity of our will lend each other mutual support"—that the need to defend our position gives us motivation to keep working on the argument rather than prematurely folding, and that this isn't even particularly bad for the cause of Truth in the world given that the other guy is going to be doing it, too.

But the perversity of our will is still perverse! That's the opposite of normative!

Sometimes the adversariality of debate is formalized, as in court trials. The plantiff and defendant's counsel each have their functional roles to play within the system, and that role is not to be fully general truthseekers. (That's closer to the judge and jury's job.) In that context, we can say that it is normatively correct that a lawyer should argue for her client's interests, rather than to disinterestedly persue the truth of the case.

But in the absence of such formalized roles, where it's understood that the individual is to be a cog in a larger system—no, it is not normatively correct to refuse to budge in response to counterarguments! When I'm having a discussion, and my interlocutor makes a point against my "side"—or if I notice it independently—I want to acknowledge it right then and there. It's not a natural impulse, but I think it's learnable, and worth learning, as a step towards a better world.

Because—normatively—there shouldn't be "sides". Or if there should be sides, that means the interaction is [a conflict rather than a disagreement, and it would be normatively correct to reveal that fact, rather than maintaining confusion about it](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/e4GBj6jxRZcsHFSvP/assume-bad-faith).
