# Said Achmiz in His Felon Stripes Stands Far Above You Now

> If, beyond these, there are those here tonight who have ever forced intellectual deference from a peer, those who have prostituted themselves in the name of Charity, those who have brought confused, immoral, or unexamined arguments to the light, without the means of defense for them, and yet will go from this post and say, "Said Achmiz is an unclean man—a man rewarded by just punishment," then to _you_ I say, and may the words ring deep within your ears _until you die_: go on! Drive your sheep to the shambles! Crush that old, uncouth man beneath your Juggernaut! In the name of Niceness, Community, and Civilization, do it! In the name of the Chicagoan who preached the twelve virtues, do it! In the name of Clear Thinking, Clear Communication, and Collaborative Truthseeking, do it! In the name of Epistemic Hygiene put yourself on the side of the concern troll in the comment sections, the censor in the moderation thread, the prevaricator in public fora, the whole brute force of the karma system, the mod team, and the banhammer, to persecute one honest man who stood alone against your licensed mendacity! Do it. And if Said Achmiz dies outside your "well-kept garden", be satisfied _when you have murdered him!_ Kill him! And you hasten the day when the Future shall bury you ten thousand fathoms deep beneath its curses. Kill him! And the stripes upon his prison clothes shall lash you like the knout! Kill him! And the insane shall glitter hate at you with their wild eyes, the unborn babes shall cry their blood upon you, and the graves that you have filled in the name of Discourse, shall yield food for a race that will pillory you, until the memory of your atrocity has become a nameless ghost, flitting with the shades of Meletus, Urban VIII, and Lysenko over the horizon of the World!

> Would you smile to see him dead? Would you say, "We are rid of this obscenist"? Fools! The corpse would laugh at you from its cold eyelids! The motionless lips would mock, and the solemn hands, the pulseless, folded hands, in their quietness would write the last indictment, which neither Time nor you can efface. Kill him! And you write his glory and your shame! Said Achmiz in his felon stripes stands far above you now, and Said Achmiz _dead_ will live on, immortal in the race he died to free! Kill him!

Oliver Habyrka begins what I can only describe as [an astonishing document](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/98sCTsGJZ77WgQ6nE/banning-said-achmiz-and-broader-thoughts-on-moderation) by contrasting two frequently voiced perspectives on the culture of _Less Wrong_.

On the one hand, it is said that "LessWrong is a place that really forces you to get your arguments together", that its straight-shooting culture is "one of the things that makes it one of the most valuable forums on the internet."

On the other hand, it is said that using the website "seems really unrewarding" because:

> You show up, you put a ton of effort into a post, and at the end the comment section will tear apart some random thing that isn't load bearing for your argument, isn't something you consider particularly important, and whose discussion doesn't illuminate what you are trying to communicate, all the while implying that they are superior in their dismissal of your irrational and dumb ideas.

Habyrka opines that "both of these perspectives are right."

I would go further. It's not just that both of these perspectives are right. It's that you can't have one without the other. By what means can a web forum "really force you to get your arguments together"?

There is only one means: by commenters pointing out all the places where a post says something wrong—anything wrong. If the error wasn't "load bearing for your argument", it's still worth pointing out in the comment section. (We're not going to run out of _paper_.) It doesn't matter if it "isn't something you consider particularly important." (If it's so unimportant that you don't even want to receive corrections, then what was it doing in the post?) If the "discussion doesn't illuminate what you are trying to communicate", it's worth considering whether that's because you failed to communicate it; "Yes, and—" requires the possibility of "No, because—".

[TODO: write and link "Yes, and" prerequisite]

(As for "implying that they are superior in their dismissal of your irrational and dumb ideas", I suppose it's true that when someone rejects an idea, that inescapably creates a logical implication that the rejecter thinks that they possess some kind of superior discernment than the idea's proposer. It seems like a weird and petty implication to focus on, though. Who cares?)

What is most striking about this list of reasons that critical commenters make _Less Wrong_ unrewarding to interact with is what it does _not_ say. _It doesn't say the commenters are wrong!_ If the second perspective had claimed that commenters _mischaracterize_ posts (rather than merely failing to "illuminate what [authors] are trying to communicate"), that would be a serious problem that would warrant corrective actions by moderators.

Thus, it would seem that the two complementary perspectives described by Habryka are describing a success story of a vibrant intellectual forum with a culture of excellence that cares fanatically about getting things right via the power of vigorous and rigorous discussion. Posting on _Less Wrong_ is "unrewarding" in the sense that you don't get rewarded just for posting; the rewards have to be earned.

Habryka states that "few people have done as much to shape the culture of LessWrong" than one Said Achmiz. I think this is giving Achmiz far too much credit. I think _Less Wrong_'s culture of excellence derives from the legacy of Eliezer Yudkowsky's Sequences attracting a userbase that cares about getting things right. Achmiz is only #43 on [the all-time karma list](https://www.lesswrong.com/leaderboard) and is better seen in historical context as an inheritor of the culture of excellence rather than one of its originators.

But granting for the sake of argument that Habyrka is right to attribute such influence to Achmiz, one wonders what the occasion of bringing it up is. The natural assumption is that the post must be announcing Achmiz as the recipient of some kind of award or honor, right?

Right?

Habryka goes on to say that many users see Achmiz as serving a vital function of preventing the culture from falling into a mutual sycophancy failure mode which Habyrka calls the "LinkedIn attractor." He identifies Achmiz as the "bearer of a flag" which is worth quoting in full (bold in original):

> "Just because you are hurt by, and anxious about others criticizing you or your ideas, doesn't mean we are going to accommodate you. It is the responsibility of your audience to determine what they think of you and your contributions.
>
> **You do not own your reputation. Every individual owns their own judgment of you.**
>
> You can shape it by doing good or bad things, but you do not get to shape it by preventing me and others from openly discussing you and your contributions."

Habryka writes that he "really care[s] about this flag too" and that "much of the decisions [he has] made around LessWrong have been to foster a culture that understands and rallies behind this flag." He expresses hope that his acknowledgement of the risks of sycophancy will give supporters of the culture of excellence "a bit more trust that [he is] tracking some things they care about."

And it would give a bit more trust _if Habyrka were telling the truth_.

But the remainder of the post persistently construes intellectual criticism as "punishments" or as claims to have "violated some social norm", and ultimately announces a ban of Achmiz on the grounds that the judgements Achmiz expresses have deleterious social effects (bringing the site closer to what Habyrka calls the Sneer Attractor). The entire point of the post is to announce that the moderators are "preventing [Achmiz] from openly discussing [_Less Wrong_ authors] and [their] contributions"!

One can only infer that Habryka is lying or self-deluding when he claims to care about a "Every individual owns their own judgment of you" principle. One almost has to wonder if the text of the "flag" was ghostwritten; Habyrka shows little sign of even understanding the concept in any other context.

[TODO: um, this needs revision or more likely a followup paragraph because it's not true; he seems to understand it fine re: e.g. Will MacAskill, just not the people he wants to use his website]

[TODO—
The initial "Zetetic Explanation" comment was _not_ vague and high-level put-down! Reading it that way is just poor reading comprehension. It was expresssed elliptically by juxtaposing the "ordinary means" and "Robinson Crusoe" quotes. Is that a good criticism? I don't know; it's a judgement call! But it's clearly in-bounds.

What?
