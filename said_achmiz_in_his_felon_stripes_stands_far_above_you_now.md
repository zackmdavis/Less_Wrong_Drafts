# Said Achmiz in His Felon Stripes Stands Far Above You Now

> If, beyond these, there are those here tonight who have ever forced intellectual deference from a peer, those who have prostituted themselves in the name of Charity, those who have brought confused, immoral, or unexamined arguments to the light, without the means of defense for them, and yet will go from this post and say, "Said Achmiz is an unclean man—a man rewarded by just punishment," then to _you_ I say, and may the words ring deep within your ears _until you die_: go on! Drive your sheep to the shambles! Crush that old, uncouth man beneath your Juggernaut! In the name of Niceness, Community, and Civilization, do it! In the name of the Chicagoan who preached the twelve virtues, do it! In the name of Clear Thinking, Clear Communication, and Collaborative Truthseeking, do it! In the name of Epistemic Hygiene put yourself on the side of the concern troll in the comment sections, the censor in the moderation thread, the prevaricator in public fora, the whole brute force of the karma system, the mod team, and the banhammer, to persecute one honest man who stood alone against your licensed mendacity! Do it. And if Said Achmiz dies outside your "well-kept garden", be satisfied _when you have murdered him!_ Kill him! And you hasten the day when the Future shall bury you ten thousand fathoms deep beneath its curses. Kill him! And the stripes upon his prison clothes shall lash you like the knout! Kill him! And the insane shall glitter hate at you with their wild eyes, the unborn babes shall cry their blood upon you, and the graves that you have filled in the name of Discourse, shall yield food for a race that will pillory you, until the memory of your atrocity has become a nameless ghost, flitting with the shades of Meletus, Urban VIII, and Lysenko over the horizon of the World!

### "If I Can't Explain It to Said Achmiz, I Probably Don't Understand It"

This is a tribute to my friend Said Achmiz, the wisest person I know.

The choice of adjective is deliberately chosen as term of art. Achmiz is not the most quick-witted, nor the most knowledgable, nor the most creative, nor the most savvy. I say _wise_ because the nature of his peculiar talent is the same one ascribed to [Socrates](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JcgtKunqmELefxksx/killing-socrates): [_he knows what he doesn't know_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_that_I_know_nothing).

Most people don't. At least, I don't. All too often, when asked, "Do you get what I'm saying?", I reply, "I think so" with perfect subjective sincerity, only realizing later that I was lying—that I could not have paraphrased my interlocutor's ideas, let alone explained where I agreed or disagreed with them. In retrospect (and only in retrospect), it's clear that I didn't want to disrupt the harmonious give-and-take flow of social exchange, that I feared being seen as foolish or obstinate for having the temerity to say, "No, I don't understand"—and to continue standing by that _No_ should understanding not be forthcoming.

The unique genius of Achmiz is simply that he's not afraid to be seen as foolish or obstinate. If he doesn't understand how you're using a term, he'll ask for a definition. If he doesn't see how to apply your abstract claim, he'll ask for an example. If your offered definition or example doesn't make sense to him, he'll say so. _Bluffing doesn't work on him._

Occasionally it strikes me as a little odd when Achmiz asks something that I think he should have been able to figure out by himself, but it's no trouble. If I can spare the time, I'm usually happy to type up the requested additional explanation. If I can't spare the time, there's a chance someone else in the cyber-agora might pitch in and supply it.

But if I can spare the time but can't come up with an explanation that will satisfy Socrates, that's an alarming warning sign that my grasp of the topic isn't as firm as thought: I didn't know what I didn't know.

But there's also such a thing as people who combine an above-average need for rigor with a below-average need for social harmony, to the result that they can't be bluffed—who are incredibly valuable to have around to help check that you aren't fooling yourself. Mostly, I figure that if I can't explain it to Socrates, I probably don't understand it.

### An Inversion of Values

Oliver Habyrka begins what I can only describe as [an astonishing document](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/98sCTsGJZ77WgQ6nE/banning-said-achmiz-and-broader-thoughts-on-moderation) by contrasting two frequently voiced perspectives on the culture of _Less Wrong_.

On the one hand, it is said that "LessWrong is a place that really forces you to get your arguments together", that its straight-shooting culture is "one of the things that makes it one of the most valuable forums on the internet."

On the other hand, it is said that using the website "seems really unrewarding" because:

> You show up, you put a ton of effort into a post, and at the end the comment section will tear apart some random thing that isn't load bearing for your argument, isn't something you consider particularly important, and whose discussion doesn't illuminate what you are trying to communicate, all the while implying that they are superior in their dismissal of your irrational and dumb ideas.

Habyrka opines that "both of these perspectives are right."

I would go further. It's not just that both of these perspectives are right. It's that you can't have one without the other. By what means can a web forum "really force you to get your arguments together"?

There is only one means: by commenters pointing out all the places where a post says something wrong—anything wrong. If the error wasn't "load bearing for your argument", it's still worth pointing out in the comment section. (We're not going to run out of _paper_.) It doesn't matter if it "isn't something you consider particularly important." (If it's so unimportant that you don't even want to receive corrections, then what was it doing in the post?)

If the "discussion doesn't illuminate what you are trying to communicate", it's worth asking: why is that? If it were because the commenters are for some perverse reason pretending _en masse_ to not understand your clear and correct explanations, then that would be bad. But if it's because your explanations were not, in fact, clear and correct, then disappointment was inevitable: commenters can't illuminate what you're trying to communicate if you didn't successfully communicate it.

As a perennial _Less Wrong_ author of over 90 posts, including 8 Curated posts, I have the experience to testify on this matter. Yes, it is disappointing when a post doesn't land in the comment section the way I wanted it to, but it's obviously not because commenters are culpably witholding their illumination of my precious ideas. It's because writing about ideas is hard and I don't always get it right.  Sometimes I'm wrong, sometimes I'm confused, sometimes I don't write clearly—[and](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XbXJZjwinkoQXu4db/funk-tunul-s-legacy-or-the-legend-of-the-extortion-war) [it](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/67NrgoFKCWmnG3afd/you-ll-never-persuade-people-like-that) [shows](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rzFrwWvvpgzfnwSeB/some-basic-level-of-mutual-respect-about-whether-other) in the comment section and the karma score. I certainly prefer it when the discussion illuminates what I was trying to communicate, but the only real way to accomplish that is by me writing something that commenters as individuals find illuminating—and there's always the possibility of that not happening when people are being honest, rather that sycophantically colluding to flatter the author's ego. "Yes, and—" requires the possibility of "No, because—".

[TODO: write and link "Yes, and" prerequisite]

(As for "implying that they are superior in their dismissal of your irrational and dumb ideas", I suppose it's true that when someone rejects an idea, that [creates a logical implication that the rejecter thinks they're more rational than the idea-proposer on that topic](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/disagreement-ishtml). It's a weirdly petty implication to focus on, though. Who cares? This is a blog, not some kind of beauty pageant that awards a sash and cash prize for the "best rationalist".)

What is most striking about the second perspective's list of reasons that critical commenters make _Less Wrong_ unrewarding to interact with is what it does _not_ say. _It doesn't say the commenters are wrong!_ If the second perspective had claimed that commenters _mischaracterize_ posts (rather than merely criticizing non-"load bearing" aspects of the posts or failing to "illuminate what [authors] are trying to communicate"), that would be a serious problem that would warrant corrective actions by moderators. We can infer that bad arguments and strawmanning are not seen by user reports as a pervasive problem on _Less Wrong_. [(If it were, the second perspective would have mentioned it.)](https://www.readthesequences.com/Absence-Of-Evidence-Is-Evidence-Of-Absence)

Thus, it would seem that the two complementary perspectives described by Habryka are describing a success story of a vibrant intellectual forum with a culture of excellence that cares fanatically about getting things right via the power of vigorous and rigorous discussion. It's true that posting on _Less Wrong_ can be "unrewarding"—but that's because the rewards are real and therefore have to be earned.

Habryka states that "few people have done as much to shape the culture of LessWrong" than one Said Achmiz. I think this is giving Achmiz far too much credit. I think _Less Wrong_'s culture of excellence derives from the legacy of Eliezer Yudkowsky's Sequences attracting a userbase that cares about getting things right. Achmiz is only #43 on [the all-time karma list](https://www.lesswrong.com/leaderboard) and is better seen in historical context as an inheritor of the culture of excellence rather than one of its originators.

[TODO: Habyrka says "place 20 in how people would bring up your name. I think this would be an underestimate of your effect on the culture", so maybe not too much disagreement?]

But granting for the sake of argument that Habyrka is right to attribute such influence to Achmiz, one wonders what the occasion of bringing it up is. The natural assumption is that the post must be announcing Achmiz as the recipient of some kind of award.

> There are selection effects on who stays in the community under these conditions.
Indeed. For example, if a community selects for phonies who want people to lie to them in order to protect their feelings, and selects against people who want to have real, honest conversations, then you end up with a community full of phonies.

### If "Every Individual Owns Their Own Judgment of You", Then the Ban Rationale Makes No Sense

Habyrka goes on to articulate two alleged failure modes of online communities. 

[TODO: summarize Sneer and LinkedIn Attractors]

Habryka goes on to say that many users see Achmiz as serving a vital function of preventing _Less Wrong_ from falling into the LinkedIn Attractor.

He identifies Achmiz as the "bearer of a flag" which is worth quoting in full (bold in original):

> "Just because you are hurt by, and anxious about others criticizing you or your ideas, doesn't mean we are going to accommodate you. It is the responsibility of your audience to determine what they think of you and your contributions.
>
> **You do not own your reputation. Every individual owns their own judgment of you.**
>
> You can shape it by doing good or bad things, but you do not get to shape it by preventing me and others from openly discussing you and your contributions."

Well spoken! Habryka writes that he "really care[s] about this flag too" and that "much of the decisions [he has] made around LessWrong have been to foster a culture that understands and rallies behind this flag." He expresses hope that his acknowledgement of the risks of sycophancy will give supporters of the culture of excellence "a bit more trust that [he is] tracking some things they care about."

And it would give a bit more trust _if Habyrka were telling the truth_. But the remainder of the post persistently construes criticism as "punishments" or as claims to have "violated some social norm", and ultimately announces a ban of Achmiz on the grounds that the judgements Achmiz expresses have deleterious social effects (bringing the site closer to what Habyrka calls the Sneer Attractor). The entire point of the post is to announce that the moderators are "preventing [Achmiz] from openly discussing [_Less Wrong_ authors] and [their] contributions"!

One can only infer that Habryka is lying or self-deluding when he claims to care about a "Every individual owns their own judgment of you" principle. One almost has to wonder if the text of the "flag" was ghostwritten; Habyrka shows no sign of even understanding the concept anywhere else in the post.

[TODO—
The initial "Zetetic Explanation" comment was _not_ vague and high-level put-down! Reading it that way is just poor reading comprehension. It was expresssed elliptically by juxtaposing the "ordinary means" and "Robinson Crusoe" quotes. Is that a good criticism? I don't know; it's a judgement call! But it's clearly in-bounds.

### You Can Too Ignore Unwanted Comments

Unless you want to grant people a Said-free LW experience _without being made to feel guilty_
"Said himself doesn't think ignoring him is an option" is a cheap gotcha that doesn't stand up to logical scrutiny; the whole point is that _you disagree with him on that_
The quoted 2020 comment is a willful misrepresentation of Achmiz's views
He clarified his position later in that thread, and we know that Habyrka knows this because Achmiz wrote a comment about it in the moderation thread
There was also a comment where Achmiz explicitly clarified that people shouldn't reply if they don't expect it to be productive (which I linked to Ben Pace on Messenger, so the mod team knows about it)
The implications of not replying happen in the heads of readers doing Bayesian reasoning
What's being expressed in the 2020 thread is a view that such questions _are_ in fact productive; Achmiz agrees with the conditional that _if_ it's not productive, then it's fine not to engage

In the lead-up discussion, Habyrka denied there being a list of banned ideas

exactly—LW is a place where people suck up to Habyrka's friends

### Effort Ratios Are Logically Irrelevant

[TODO: some kinds of criticism having easier jobs than thesis-proposers is a fact about reality!

(Sometimes criticism involves building a counter-thesis, and the "author" vs. "critic" roles in an ongoing conversation are not clear-cut, but the question-asking aspect is asymmetric.)

If you're trying to jigger the status rewards, fine, critical questions should be _worth less_ than writing a post .. but the place to intervene is in the rewards, not by censoring the criticism! That is, if you care about being correct.

### Reply to Vaniver on "Emotional Tallness"

Lightcone Infrastructure board member and _Less Wrong_ BDFL Vaniver [commented on the ban announcement](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/98sCTsGJZ77WgQ6nE/banning-said-achmiz-and-broader-thoughts-on-moderation?commentId=j57cuznkZBXqSn7sr).

[TODO—

the choice of metaphor in "emotional tallness" being something immutable is telling; someone who thought it was a good thing would use the usual metaphor, strength

> I think I used to view this as “a rationalist virtue I possess” and now I view it more as “an incidental fact about me”—like, my IQ is also relevant to my rationality but it’s not really a “rationalist virtue” instead of the amount of horsepower that I’m working with.
man, I think I just want to bite the bullet on IQ being a "rationalist virtue". What matters is not some cosmic sense moral "desert", but that qualities are needed in an engine of cognition to do the job. If an 80 IQ person can't do the things we need rationalists to do in this world, oh, well—same deal with emotionally short people. You don't want to change the rules of the discussion to _cater to the needs of low IQ people_

> I’m still not sure what Zack or Said think of the Royal Society example
TODO—I need to read Vaniver's Royal Society post to understand what he's talking about

Indeed, and what's the reply?

> I do believe that our view is more sophisticated, and I operationalize this by something like ITT-passing
As I've written about, The ITT is not appropriate for this use-case!! I can't pass an ITT on Islam or ESP

> people often raise objections about commenters that don’t make sense as logical criticisms. But if they aren’t intended as logical criticisms, that seems irrelevant to me. (Perhaps it is worth rereading Feeling Rational.)
I agree with "Feeling Rational"; for me, it emerges as righteous outrage at these frauds who are trying to silence information to protect people's feelings

> I will finish with this comment from 12 years ago, in which I criticize Eliezer’s moderation practices. I was missing the concept of emotional tallness, then [...] I can see the younger me levelling a similar criticism at the mod team now.
