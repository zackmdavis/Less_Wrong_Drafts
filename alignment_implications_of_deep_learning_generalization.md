## Alignment Implications of Deep Learning Generalization: Another Discussion in One Act

### Scene 0 (Prologue)

_[Setting: a suburban house, in cross-section: the house's front wall divides the stage in half. On the audience's left, a dishevelled **Doomimir** sits in an easy chair, facing a television. On the audience's right, we see the front porch.]_

**Doomimir**: It wasn't supposed to end like this. Not like this. I was made for a better world ...

[_**Simplicia** enters stage left. She rings the doorbell._]

**Doomimir**: Who is it?

**Simplicia**: Simplicia Optimistovna Dobraya.

**Doomimir**: _[muttering as he goes to the door]_ Good-hearted daughter of a fool ... _[opening the door]_ Well? What do you want?

**Simplicia**: _[disturbed by his appearance]_ Doomimir Doomovitch, have you been drinking?

**Doomimir**: _[insulted]_ What do you take me for?

**Simplicia**: _[even more disturbed]_ Doomimir Doomovitch, have you been watching television?

**Doomimir**:  _[shrugging]_ Yes. _[gruffly]_ Again, what do you want?

**Simplicia**: I can't stop thinking about [our last conversation](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pYWA7hYJmXnuyby33/alignment-implications-of-llm-successes-a-debate-in-one-act). It was kind of all over the place. I'd like to continue, but focusing more narrowly on a few points I'm still confused about.

**Doomimir**: And why should I bother tutoring an Earth woman in alignment theory? If you didn't get it from the empty string, and you didn't get it from our last discussion, why should I have any hope of you learning this time? And even if you did, [what good would it do?](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4Gcz3fGcYmmzhozxr/hashing-out-long-standing-disagreements-seems-low-value-to) You're a rando with no political power or scientific credentials. Are _you_ to stop Magma from destroying the world?

**Simplicia**: My mother named me Simplicia, over my father's objections, on account of my unexpectedly low polygenic scores. I am aware of my inferiority.

**Doomimir**: Then why are you here?

**Simplicia**: _[serenely]_ If the world is ending either way, I think it's more dignified that I understand exactly why. _[A beat.]_ Sorry, that doesn't explain what's in it for you. That's why I had to ask.

**Doomimir**: What _is_ it in for me?

**Simplicia**: _[going through her wallet]_ Two thousand rubles?

**Doomimir**: As you say. If the world is ending either way. _[He takes the money and shuts the door.]_

_[Simplicia smiles and gives the audience a thumbs-up.]_

### Scene 1 (The Discussion)

_[Later, inside the house. Doomimir has washed up and seems to be in a relatively better mood.]_

**Doomimir**: What are you confused about? I mean, that you wanted to talk about.
