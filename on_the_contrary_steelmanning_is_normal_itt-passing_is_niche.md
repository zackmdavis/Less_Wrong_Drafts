## On the Contrary, Steelmanning Is Normal; ITT-Passing Is Niche

Rob Bensinger argues that ["ITT-passing and civility are good; 'charity' is bad; steelmanning is niche"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MdZyLnLHuaHrCskjy/itt-passing-and-civility-are-good-charity-is-bad).

The ITT—[Ideological Turing Test](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/the_ideological.html)—is an exercise in which one attempts to present one's interlocutor's views as persuasively as they can, coined in analogy to the Turing Test for distinguishing between humans and intelligent machines. (An AI that can pass as human must presumably possess human-like understanding; an opponent of an idea that can pass as an advocate for it presumably must possess an advocate's understanding of the idea.)

"Steelmanning" refers to the practice of addressing a stronger version of an interlocutor's argument, coined in disanalogy to ["strawmanning"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man), the crime of addressing a weaker version of an interlocutor's argument in the hopes of fooling an audience (or oneself) that the original argument has been rebutted.

Bensinger describes steelmanning as "a useful niche skill", but thinks it isn't "a standard thing you bring out in most arguments". Instead, he writes, discussions should be structured around object-level learning, trying to pass each other's Ideological Turing Test (construed as being about substance rather than style), or trying resolve cruxes.

I don't think the Ideological Turing Test belongs on the same list as the other two things.

 * The basic issue is that "modeling what another person thinks about reality" is usually less interesting than just directly modeling reality.
 * I couldn't pass an ITT for Islam or extrasensory perception, but that seems basically fine; I already have reasons 

 * I agree that ITT-passing is desirable; the basic case for its desirability is that it's a check that you and your interlocutor are talking about the same thing rather than you strawmanning them.
 * I also agree (as Bensinger quotes Yudkowsky) that there's a failure mode of steelmanning-as-weakmanning
 * _After_ engaging with someone, you should do a better job of passing their ITT (and it would be worrying if you couldn't), but that doesn't mean ITT-passing should be the focus of the discussion, contrasted to good old-fashioned debate

 * In contrast, steelmanning is oriented towards improving arguments 

 * Think about trying to write computer programs instead of building arguments. If someone says, "Hey, you should do it this way"; adopting it with improvements is a completely ordinary thing
