> I think we should keep as a live hypothesis "this person finds Said's comments annoying because they are directing attention at the hole in their argument." As someone who likes finding the hole in their argument and then developing the argument further, this never annoyed me. But this isn't the only hypothesis and I think often Said or Zack acted as tho it was.

I agree that it's not the only hypothesis, because there's never only one hypothesis! But I do think it should usually be the dominant hypothesis. By way of illustration, consider that the justice system has a concept called [_adverse inference_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_inference). If the plantiff in a court case wants to cite a document that turns out to have been shredded by the defendant, the judge can instruct the jury to assume that the document was unfavorable to the defendant's case.

Is that unfair? The document could have been shredded for any number of perfectly innocent reasons!

Well, it _could_ have. But—really? Really? In Bayesian terms, the probability of the document being shredded given that it hurts the defendant's case is reasonably high, but the probability of the document being shredded given that it doesn't affect the defendant's case is low. Why destroy that _particular_ document?

I think a similar skepticism should apply to censorship of criticism. Why not just downvote it and let it sit largely unheeded by readers at the bottom of the page—unless you're worried that readers _will_ heed it?

The phrasing of your comment seems to suggest that at some level, this is also your model: you write, "As someone who _likes_ finding the hole in their argument and then developing the argument further, this never annoyed me," attributing your lack of annoyance to your rationality. You then disclaim that "this isn't the only hypothesis." No doubt—but out of the infinitude of possible alternate explanations, which ones do you find the most plausible, and why? If you're not just saying "this isn't the only hypothesis" as a vacuous platitude, you must have something specific in mind. What is it? _Reply!_

> Despite my disagreement I endorse Habryka unilaterally taking these kinds of decisions and approve of his [...] conduct in this matter.

Why? If you think Achmiz's posts are clear, crisp, and valuable and that the examples in the post don't seem compelling, then that would seem to imply that Habyrka is making a terrible decision and that you should therefore disapprove of his conduct. Is the idea that it's critical for coordination purposes to have a dictator, any dictator, such that it doesn't actually matter whether they make good decisions? _Reply!_

> if I'm too much of a coward to risk _an unknown internet commenter_ saying possibly bad things about my own comments, then I really don't belong here anyway

That's almost right, except that I don't think such cowardice is an immutable feature of anyone's character. I think if you took the risk, you'd see that an unknown internet commenter saying possibly bad things about your own comment not only isn't that bad, but is often good, because you learn something from reading the comment and possibly writing your own counter-reply. It would be a growth experience.

> in a way that strongly annoys some people for essentially superficial reasons. And he's being either persistently oblivious or illegibly principled in how that keeps happening, in ways that seem eminently avoidable by adjusting how he's talking at a superficial level, without impacting any substantive points he's making

I don't think the principle is that illegible, and I don't think superficial changes would have appeased his persecutors.

As an example of what an actually superficial conflict over writing style would look like, I'm probably not the only one who's annoyed that Vaniver spells _although_ as _altho_, but there's no coalition demanding him to adopt standard English orthography or be deposed. No one wants to do that, because that would be petty, and it would be pretty precisely because it's superficial: both spellings mean the same thing.

In contrast, the people who wanted Achmiz to write words that convey a different tone is because the different words would have a different meaning. The kind of people who would make that demand wouldn't be satisfied with mere compliance, [because it would be easy to infer that Achmiz was only saying what was demanded of him as the price of being allowed to speak at all](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pC74aJyCRgns6atzu/meta-discussion-from-circling-as-cousin-to-rationality?commentId=g6vrAMkHmCHTRa4C2) These people don't want compliance. They want submission.
