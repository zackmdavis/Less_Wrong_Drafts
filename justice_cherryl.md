### "Justice, Cherryl."

## I.

An unfortunate obstacle to appreciating the work of Ayn Rand (as someone who adores the ["sense of life"](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/sense_of_life.html) portrayed in Rand's fiction, while having a much lower opinion of her philosophy) is that when Rand praises selfishness and condemns altruism, she's using the words "selfishness" and "altruism" in her own idiosyncratic ideological sense, that doesn't really match how most people would use those words.

It's true that Rand's heroes are relatively selfish in the sense of being primarily concerned with their own life and work, rather than their effects on others.

But if you look at what the characters _do_ (not just the doctrines they profess), Rand's villains are _also_ selfish in the conventional sense, using guile and political maneuvering to acquire power and line their own pockets, while claiming to be acting for the common good. In _Atlas Shrugged_, for example, the various directives ostensibly issued for the economic health of the country, are seen to instead benefit politically-connected crony capitalists like Jim Taggart and Orren Boyle. In [_Think Twice_](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThinkTwice), the philanthropist Walter Beckenridge cultivates an public image as an inventor and benefactor of humanity, while actually taking credit for his junior partner's work, and deriving gratification from exerting power over the people he "helps" (for example, adopting a disabled son from a father who couldn't support him, and denying the boy a surgery that would have allowed him to walk).

Despite [paying lip service to a pretense of only trading and never giving](http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/on-the-fetishization-of-money-in-galts-gulch/), we _also_ see examples of Rand's heroes being altruistic in the conventional sense, of being motivated to help others.

In _Atlas Shrugged_, Hank Rearden

rearranges 

"It's so much for him, thought Rearden, and so little for me!"




Overall, when I look at the universe portrayed in Rand's fiction, it seems to me that the implied moral isn't that altruism is bad.

It's that altruists _don't exist_. The people claiming to be altruists are _lying_. The distinguishing feature of our heroes isn't, actually, that they're unusually selfish. It's that they're _honest_ about being selfish.



Given that everyone is mostly selfish and everyone has to eat, the question is: are you going to eat by means of production and trade, or by—other means?

_That's_ the distinction between Rand's heroes and villains. The heroes want to get rich _by means of_ doing genuinely good work that other people will have a genuine self-interest in paying for. 


As Greg Hastings, the district attorney in _Think Twice_, puts it: "[T]he man who admits that he cares for money is all right. He's usually worth the money he makes. He won't kill for it. He doesn't have to. But watch out for the man who yells too loudly how much he scorns money. Watch out particularly for the one who yells that others must scorn it. He's after something much worse than money."

In particular, fame and wealth acquired by fraud obviously "don't count."


> "You'll get everything society can give a man. You'll keep all the money. You'll take any fame or honor anyone might want to grant. You'll accept such gratitude as the tenants might feel. And I—I'll take what nobody can give a man, except himself. I will have built Cortlandt."
>
> "You're getting more than I am, Howard."




"I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine."


The ultimate sin in Rand's moral universe isn't _giving_ charity. (Because, within the ideology, helping those others whom _you_ want to help, is selfish.) What's evil is _demanding_ charity, expecting other people to work for your benefit because _you_ supposedly need them to.

My favorite scene in _Atlas Shrugged_ 

"I married Jim because I ... I thought that he was _you_."

It's worth quoting at length:

> "You've had a terrible time, haven't you?" [said Dagny.]
>
> "Yes ... but that doesn't matter ... that's my own problem ... and my own fault."
>
> "I don't think it was your own fault."
>
> Cherryl did not answer, then said suddenly, desperately, "Look ... what I don't want is charity."
>
> "Jim must have told you—and it's true—that I never engage in charity."
>
> "Yes, he did ... But what I mean is—"
>
> "I know what you mean."
>
> "But there's no reason why you should have to feel concern for me ... I didn't come here to complain and ... and load another burden on your shoulders. ... That I happen to suffer, doesn't give me a claim on you."
>
> "No, it doesn't. But that you value all the things I value, does."
>
> "You mean ... if you want to talk to me, it's not alms? Not just because you feel sorry for me?"
>
> "I feel terribly sorry for you, Cherryl, and I'd like to help you—not because you suffer, but because you haven't deserved to suffer."
>
> "You mean, you wouldn't be kind to anything weak or whining or rotten about me? Only to whatever you see in me that's good?"
>
> "Of course."
>
> Cherryl did not move her head, but she looked as if it were lifted—as if some bracing current were relaxing her features into that rare look which combines pain and dignity.
>
> "It's not alms, Cherryl. Don't be afraid to speak to me."
>
> [...]
>
> "You know, Miss Tag—Dagny," she said softly, in wonder, "you're not as I expected you to be at all. ... They, Jim and his friends, they said you were hard and cold and unfeeling."
>
> "But it's true, Cherryl, I _am_, in the sense they mean—only have they ever told you in just what sense they mean it?"
>
> "No. They never do. They only sneer at me when I ask them what they mean by anything ... about anything. What did they mean about you?"
>
> "Whenever anyone accuses some person of being 'unfeeling', he means that that person is just. He means that that person has no causeless emotions and will not grant him a feeling which he does not deserve. He means that 'to feel' is to go against reason, against moral values, against reality. He means ... What's the matter?" she asked, seeing the abnormal intensity of the girl's face.
>
> "It's ... it's something I've tried so hard to understand ... for such a long time. ..."
>
> "Well, observe that you never hear that accusation in defense of innocence, but always in defense of guilt. You never hear it said by a good person about those who fail to do him justice. But you always hear it said by a rotter about those who treat him as a rotter, those who don't feel any sympathy for the evil he's committed or for the pain he suffers as a consequence. Well, it's true—_that_ is what I do not feel. But those who feel it, feel nothing for any quality of human greatness, for any person or action that deserves admiration, approval, esteem. _These_ are the things _I_ feel. You'll find that it's one or the other. Those who grant sympathy to guilt, grant none to innocence. Ask yourself which, of the two, are the _unfeeling_ persons. And then you'll see what motive is the opposite of charity."

> "What?" she whispered.
