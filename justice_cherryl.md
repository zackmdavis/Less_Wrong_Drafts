### "Justice, Cherryl."

## I.

An unfortunate obstacle to appreciating the work of Ayn Rand (as someone who adores the "sense of life" portrayed in Rand's fiction, without buying her philosophy) is that when Rand praises selfishness and condemns altruism, she's using the words "selfishness" and "altruism" in her own idiosyncratic ideological sense, that doesn't really match how most people would use those words.

If you look at what the characters _do_ (not just the words they say in philosophical monologues), it's true that Rand's heroes are relatively selfish in the conventional sense, of being primarily concerned with optimizing their own lives and wanting to acquire wealth for themselves.

But Rand's villains are _also_ selfish in the conventional sense, using social maneuvering and political trickery to acquire power and line their own pockets, while claiming to be acting for the common good.

In _Atlas Shrugged_, 

In _Think Twice_, 


[TODO: Taggart/Boyle, Walter Beckenridge]

We _also_ see examples of Rand's heroes being altruistic in the conventional sense, of being motivated to help others. [TODO: Rearden "It's so much for him, and so little for me!"; Dagny saving the tramp]

Overall, when I look at the universe portrayed in Rand's fiction, it seems to me that the implied moral isn't that altruism is bad.

It's that altruists _don't exist_. The people claiming to be altruists are _lying_. The distinguishing feature of our heroes isn't, actually, that they're unusually selfish. (They mostly seem to have the normal range of human emotions, with the additional quirk of making long philosophical speeches about the virtue of selfishness and the superiority of _laissez-faire_ capitalism.) It's that they're _honest_ about being selfish. Given that everyone is mostly selfish and everyone has to eat, the question is: are you going to eat by means of production and trade, or by—other means?

_That's_ the distinction between Rand's heroes and villains. The heroes want to get rich _by means of_ doing good work that's actually worth paying for; fame and wealth acquired by fraud obviously "don't count." [TODO: "You're getting more than I am"]

The ultimate sin in Rand's moral universe (again, looking at revealed preferences and not verbal behavior) isn't _giving_ charity. (Because, within the ideology, helping those others whom _you_ want to help, is "selfish.") What's evil is _demanding_ charity, expecting other people to work for your benefit because _you_ supposedly need them to.

## II.

Something people have noticed about my intellectual style is that I like to win arguments; I like to show off how smart I am by being the one to prove other people wrong.

This is correctly noted to be a dangerous tendency.



Collaborative truthseekers _don't exist_. The people claiming to be collaborative truthseekers are _lying_.


[ when _someone who is currently trying to persaude me of something_ tells me to exert effort to think of reasons why they're right, that immediately makes me think they're more likely to be wrong: if they had an argument, they would be telling me the argument]

I will _never_ ask my interlocutors to be more "charitable" to me. (If you see me doing this, please link to this post and call me a hypocrite.) I _do_ sometimes say, "That's not what I meant," followed by an attempt to clarify, or "I don't think that's a reasonable interpretation of the text I published" when I don't think a clarification should be necessary—but the latter is a positive claim about how typical readers will interpret the text, which I expect to be able to justify to third parties. It's a claim about my interlocutor's poor reading comprhension, not about their failing any obligations to me, because they don't _have_ any obligations to me.



## III.

My favorite scene 

"I married Jim because I ... I thought that he was _you_."

It's worth quoting at length:

> "You've had a terrible time, haven't you?" [said Dagny.]
>
> "Yes ... but that doesn't matter ... that's my own problem ... and my own fault."
>
> "I don't think it was your own fault."
>
> Cherryl did not answer, then said suddenly, desperately, "Look ... what I don't want is charity."
>
> "Jim must have told you—and it's true—that I never engage in charity."
>
> "Yes, he did ... But what I mean is—"
>
> "I know what you mean."
>
> "But there's no reason why you should have to feel concern for me ... I didn't come here to complain and ... and load another burden on your shoulders. ... That I happen to suffer, doesn't give me a claim on you."
>
> "No, it doesn't. But that you value all the things I value, does."
>
> "You mean ... if you want to talk to me, it's not alms? Not just because you feel sorry for me?"
>
> "I feel terribly sorry for you, Cherryl, and I'd like to help you—not because you suffer, but because you haven't deserved to suffer."
>
> "You mean, you wouldn't be kind to anything weak or whining or rotten about me? Only to whatever you see in me that's good?"
>
> "Of course."
>
> Cherryl did not move her head, but she looked as if it were lifted—as if some bracing current were relaxing her features into that rare look which combines pain and dignity.
>
> "It's not alms, Cherryl. Don't be afraid to speak to me."
>
> [...]
>
> "You know, Miss Tag—Dagny," she said softly, in wonder, "you're not as I expected you to be at all. ... They, Jim and his friends, they said you were hard and cold and unfeeling."
>
> "But it's true, Cherryl, I _am_, in the sense they mean—only have they ever told you in just what sense they mean it?"
>
> "No. They never do. They only sneer at me when I ask them what they mean by anything ... about anything. What did they mean about you?"
>
> "Whenever anyone accuses some person of being 'unfeeling', he means that that person is just. He means that that person has no causeless emotions and will not grant him a feeling which he does not deserve. He means that 'to feel' is to go against reason, against moral values, against reality. He means ... What's the matter?" she asked, seeing the abnormal intensity of the girl's face.
>
> "It's ... it's something I've tried so hard to understand ... for such a long time. ..."
>
> "Well, observe that you never hear that accusation in defense of innocence, but always in defence of guilt. You never hear it said by a good person about those who fail to do him justice. But you always hear it said by a rotter about those who treat him as a rotter, those who don't feel any sympathy for the evil he's committed or for the pain he suffers as a consequence. Well, it's true—_that_ is what I do not feel. But those who feel it, feel nothing for any quality of human greatness, for any person or action that deserves admiration, approval, esteem. _These_ are the things _I_ feel. You'll find that it's one or the other. Those who grant sympathy to guilt, grant none to innocence. Ask yourself which, of the two, are the _unfeeling_ persons. And then you'll see what motive is the opposite of charity."

> "What?" she whispered.
