### "Justice, Cherryl."

> Selfishness and altruism are positively correlated within individuals, for the obvious reason.

## I.

An unfortunate obstacle to appreciating the work of Ayn Rand (as someone who adores the "sense of life" portrayed in Rand's fiction, without buying her philosophy) is that Rand uses the words "selfishness" and "altruism" in her own idiosyncratic ideological sense, that doesn't really match how most people would use those words.

If you look at what the characters _do_ (not just the words they say in philosophical monologues), it's true that Rand's heroes are relatively selfish in the conventional sense, of being primarily concerned with optimizing their own lives and wanting to acquire wealth for themselves.

But Rand's villains are _also_ selfish in the conventional sense.

In _Atlas Shrugged_,

We _also_ see examples of Rand's heroes being altruistic in the conventional sense, of being motivated to help others.



 * Rand talks about "selfishness" in weird, ideological ways; her heros are selfish in that they want wealth and power, but they're honest about it, they want to get rich _by means of_ doing good work that's actually worth paying for. The villains are selfish ...
 * Example of villains being selfish: Railroard and Steel Unification plans, _Think Twice_ Beckenridge 
 * Example of a hero being altruistic: Ward Harvester Company, Roark being nice to Steven Mallory

Looking at the universe of _Atlas Shrugged_ (again, not at what the characters say), it's not that altruism is bad. It's that altruists _don't exist_. The people claiming to be altruists are _lying_.


 * It's not that altruism is bad. Altruists don't exist.
 * Looking at revealed preferences, it's not that charity is bad, if the giver actually wants to give; what's evil is force charity, charity-by-right

Come back when you can model me

 * they say ITT is better than steelmanning, because ITT is measuring against a real opponent, not your hallucination of similar opinions you agree with—but I would _never_ demand that someone pass my ITT as a prerequisite for listening to their opinion

My favorite scene 

"I married Jim because I ... I thought that he was _you_."

It's worth quoting at length

----

> "You've had a terrible time, haven't you?"
>
> "Yes ... but that doesn't matter ... that's my own problem ... and my own fault."
>
> "I don't think it was your own fault."
>
> Cherryl did not answer, then said suddenly, desperately, "Look ... what I don't want is charity."
>
> "Jim must have told you—and it's true—that I never engage in charity."
>
> "Yes, he did ... But what I mean is—"
>
> "I know what you mean."
>
> "But there's no reason why you should have to feel concern for me ... I didn't come here to complain and ... and load another burden on your shoulders. ... That I happen to suffer, doesn't give me a claim on you."
>
> "No, it doesn't. But that you value all the things I value, does."
>
> "You mean ... if you want to talk to me, it's not alms? Not just because you feel sorry for me?"
>
> "I feel terribly sorry for you, Cherryl, and I'd like to help you—not because you suffer, but because you haven't deserved to suffer."
>
> "You mean, you wouldn't be kind to anything weak or whining or rotten about me? Only to whatever you see in me that's good?"
>
> "Of course."
>
> Cherryl did not move her head, but she looked as if it were lifted—as if some bracing current were relaxing her features into that rare look which combines pain and dignity.
>
> "It's not alms, Cherryl. Don't be afraid to speak to me."
>
> [...]

> "You know, Miss Tag—Dagny," she said softly, in wonder, "you're not as I expected you to be at all. ... They, Jim and his friends, they said you were hard and cold and unfeeling."
>
> "But it's true, Cherryl, I _am_, in the sense they mean—only have they ever told you in just what sense they mean it?"
>
> "No. They never do. They only sneer at me when I aske them what they mean by anything ... about anything. What did they mean about you?"
>
> "Whenever anyone accuses some person of being 'unfeeling', he means that that person is just. He means that that person has no causeless emotions and will not grant him a feeling which he does not deserve. He means that 'to feel' is to go against reason, against moral values, against reality. He means ... What's the matter?" she asked, seeing the abnormal intensity of the girl's face.
>
> "It's ... it's something I've tried so hard to understand ... for such a long time. ..."
>
> "Well, observe that you never hear that accusation in defense of innocence, but always in defence of guilt. You never hear it said by a good person about those who fail to do him justice. But you always hear it said by a rotter about those who treat him as a rotter, those who don't feel any sympathy for the evil he's committed or for the pain he suffers as a consequence. Well, it's true—_that_ is what I do not feel. But those who feel it, feel nothing for any quality of human greatness, for any person or action that deserves admiration, approval, esteem. _These_ are the things _I_ feel. You'll find that it's one or the other. Those who grant sympathy to guilt, grant none to innocence. Ask yourself which, of the two, are the _unfeeling_ persons. And then you'll see what motive is the opposite of charity."
