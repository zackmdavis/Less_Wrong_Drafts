# E. T. Jaynes and the Assumption of Observer-Biased Belief Systems

_Probability Theory: The Logic of Science_ (published posthumously after Jaynes's 1998 death), in §13.12.2, "Loss functions in human society"

> We note the sharp contrast between the roles of prior probabilities and loss functions in human relations. People with similar prior proabilities get along well together, because they have about the same general view of the world and philosophy of life. People with radically different prior probabilities cannot get along—this has been the root cause of all the religious wars and most of the political repressions throughout history.

> Loss functions operate in just the opposite way. People with similar loss functions are after the same thing, and are in contention with each other. People with different loss functions get along well because each is willing to give something the other wants. Amicable trade or business transactions, advantageous to all, are possible only between parties with very different loss functions. We illustrated this by the example of insurance above.

In contrast, in our philosophy, you don't want agents with other utility functions to exist
