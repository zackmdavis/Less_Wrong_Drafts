## Comment on "Death and the Gorgon"

(maybe don't summarize too much plot in the post, for fear that Egan might consider it an infringing substitute?)

### Plot summary

 * cryonics vault collapses, our sherriff protagonist Beth is to investigate whether foul play
    * (all Greg Egan protagonists are basically the same person)
 * fair-minded discussion of cryonics with husband
 * interviewing family members, some of the heads won a lottery by "Optimized Giving"
 * (in reality, life insurance is affordable)
 * Beth's coworker obsessed with AI assistant Sherlock
 * leading theory: competing cryonics company??
 * one family statement claims lottery winner was pressured to die early
 * characterization of OG
     * "Some of them started out sounding like worthy causes, until you hit the strange last clause" p. 171
 * partner compares to Make-A-Wish Foundation, Beth notices that cryo lottery doesn't seem very "optimized"
 * talks to OG-ologist (Emile Torres role, but as a Greg Egan character)
 * "They don't seem to be spending anything on climate change." "OG consider that solved." (p. 174) Accurate!
 * Torres speculates that the lottery is just good PR
 * "What they’re angry about is the hubris, the deception, and the waste of money."
 * Sherlock turns up Anna
 * Beth follows Anna to Dallas, who ends up being followed by someone else, too; Beth intervenes when Anna pulls out a gun
 * It transpires that lottery winners have been witnesses or POIs of shootings
 * "OG are raising funds by selling the services of terminally ill assassins. Cleanskins, with no criminal record and no connection to the victim"
 * organized crime trigged the vault collapse, as revenge/incentives
 * plan to take over apostate accounts to be the next assassin, impersonating them with an LLM
 * partner pretends to be an apostate volunteer
 * at the meeting, he takes a syringe meant to shorten his time and secure his committment
 * syringe taking was on AI's advice
 * they write a criminology journal article 
 * "on the epic struggle to make computers competent enough to help bring down the fools who believe that they’re going to be omnipotent"

### Other Notes

 * snipe at LLMs on p. 185: "Sherlock had absolutely no conception of what a movie was"
 * plausibility question: is OG big enough such that there are a lot of terminally ill assassins? (most terminal patients are old, right?) I remember it being a big deal when Hal Finney died
 * ZonesOfOught, DarkCardinal, and BayesianBae  (realistic usernames)
 * distrust of LLM decisions is well taken
 * "it had no real conception of what might happen if its words were acted on"—that part is correct! and it's an alignment problem!
 * "they need to drop the half-baked imitation of it being some kind of colleague"
 * cryonics-as-blood-money is a bit cartoony, but it's not vile slander, it rhymes with a certain strain of bloodless utilitarianism; these days, EA has billionaire support and doesn't need mob support, but back in the day, there was idle talk of life insurance suicide fraud, or Ziz's Uber-for-porn loophole idea; or SBF himself

## Egan's history of TESCREAL criticism

 * I don't want to seem too defensive, because I do hate you motherfuckers; I think I've been very clear about that in my memoir
 * There totally are culty elements: if his impression was formed from https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-safety-research-only-enables-the-dangers-of-runaway-superintelligence/ , I can see why he'd think that

 * But Egan's contempt doesn't hit the mark of exactly _why_ the scene deserves contempt, doesn't hit the good parts
 * he has a history of sniping at "us": Nate Caplan in Zendeghi, "Crystal Nights", snipe about the general intelligence theorem in Schild's Ladder
 * Torres and Gebru's TESCREAL is actually apt (EA/OG wasn't a thing at the time of the Zendeghi satire)
 * But risks of AIs not behaving as their creators intended is a real thing that Egan of course acknowledges (as in "Crystal Nights" or "Steve Fever")
 * The polises of Diaspora could have glassed the fleshers _if they wanted to_
 * I still want my Egan/Hanson collaboration

 * "Intelligence explosion microeconomics" isn't _goofy_, even if you disagree with it

 * I think I've flip-flopped on the satire of postmodernism in Terenesia: at first I was cold (while I was still a SJW), then I got it, now I'm not sure Egan is a fair critic
 * Cosma Shalizi is even worse: http://bactra.org/notebooks/nn-attention-and-transformers.html#cultists

> Oh, I think they've noticed, but some of them still like the, err, "early, funny ones" that predate the cult and hence devote no time to mocking it.

 * I'll confess that I do treasure early Egan more than later Egan, but that's not the reason: it's that I'm not smart enough to appreciate them
 * Or is the fact that I'm saying "not smart enough" a shibboleth? Egan does not seem HBD-pilled

> I still liked Zendegi & "Crystal Nights"! Books that mock my subculture can still be good on the merits! (I do find the contempt puzzling, though. What are the conditions that make mockery seem more appealing than a more tempered "I disagree with this group about this-and-such"?)

> new @gregeganSF story is ... based?? (story-universe does not hew to (unrealistic) "universalist" intelligence-implies-nonselfishness assumption often seemingly validated in other Egan stories, somewhat abating my fanciful wish for a collaboration with @robinhanson)

> This made me wonder why I am not following him on Twitter so I checked out Egan's tweets and couldn't find even one opinion that's either controversial or which violates the mainstream consensus. A bunch of woke stuff though. In other words, just noise that's to be ignored.

> Only if you're mindkilled by politics!! Knowing as much math and physics as Greg Egan is very time-consuming! Hypothetically, if we did live in a world where mainstream consensus on some less-strictly-technical topics were wrong, it shouldn't be his job to notice. 1/2
> Also, don't confuse late-20th-century-style environmentalist/human-rights liberalism with Twitter-era wokeness!! His Terenesia (1999) is very tough on postmodernism (in a way that I thought was too harsh when I read it in ~2008, but now, I get it) 2/2

> a bright teenager like Anna could have found some entertainment value analyzing the possibilities rigorously and puncturing the forums' credulous consensus.
I don't think this is true
