## Deferring General Criticism of Authors Is Not a Basic Rule of Epistemic Conduct

In [a comment on the Effective Altruism Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZS9GDsBtWJMDEyFXh/eliezer-yudkowsky-is-frequently-confidently-egregiously?commentId=7fs5nHEkK6AGgPAJ9) responding to Omnizoid's ["Eliezer Yudkowsky Is Frequently, Confidently, Egregiously Wrong"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TjyyngWFYvQWPpNNj/eliezer-yudkowsky-is-frequently-confidently-egregiously), Eliezer Yudkowsky writes:

> You will mark that in this comment I first respond to a substantive point and show it to be mistaken before I make any general criticism of the author; which can then be supported by that previously shown, initial, first-thing, object-level point. You will find every post of the Less Wrong sequences written the same way.

> As the entire post violates basic rules of epistemic conduct by opening with a series of not-yet-supported personal attacks, I will not be responding to the rest in detail. I'm sad about how anything containing such an egregious violation of basic epistemic conduct got this upvoted, and wonder about sockpuppet accounts or alternatively a downfall of EA. The relevant principle of epistemic good conduct seems to me straightforward: if you've got to make personal attacks (and sometimes you do), make them _after_ presenting your object-level points that support those personal attacks. This shouldn't be a difficult rule to follow, or follow much better than this; and violating it this hugely and explicitly is sufficiently bad news that people should've been wary about this post and hesitated to upvote it for that reason alone.

I agree that the dictum to refute an author's arguments before commenting on their character or authority is good writing advice, which I generally endeavor to follow. However, I argue that Yudkowsky errs in characterizing it as a "basic rule[ ] of epistemic conduct."

It seems to me that the reason "refutation first, character attacks only afterwards (if at all)" is good writing advice is because it guards against the all-too-human failure mode of previously intellectually fruitful conversations degenerating into _ad hominem_ and name-calling, which are not intellectually fruitful.

When I'm debating someone about some subject of broader interest to the world—for example, stamp collecting—I want to keep the conversation's focus on the subject of interest. If my interlocutor is untrustworthy, it might be worth arguing that to the audience in order to help them not be misled by my interlocutor's false claims about the subject of interest. But the relevance of the character claim to the debate needs to be clearly established. The mere truth of the claim "My interlocutor is untrustworthy" is no defense if the claim is _off-topic_ (because [argument screens off authority](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5yFRd3cjLpm3Nd6Di/argument-screens-off-authority)). The audience doesn't care about either of us. They want to hear about the stamps!

(This is probably not the _only_ reason to avoid personal attacks, but I think it's the important one.)

However, sometimes the character or authority of an author _is_ the "object-level" subject of interest. This is clearly the case for Omnizoid's post. The post is not a derailment of already ongoing discussions of epiphenominalism, decision theory, and animal consciousness. Rather, the central thesis that Omnizoid is trying to convince readers of is that Yudkowsky is frequently, confidently, egregiously wrong. The aim of the article (as Omnizoid explains in the paragraphs beginning with "The aim of this article [...]") is to discourage readers from deferring to Yudkowsky as an authority figure. Setting aside the question of whether Omnizoid's arguments succeed, is this aim, in itself, an "egregious violation of basic epistemic conduct"?

It's hard to see how it could be! "Eliezer Yudkowsky is frequently, confidently, egregiously wrong" is a testable claim about the real world. It might be true, or it might be false. It might be a claim of less broad interest to the world than the questions debated by students of decision theory, animal consciousness, or stamp collecting. (If someone told you that Mortimer Q. Snodgrass is frequently, confidently, egregiously wrong, you would ask: who is that? Why should I care? I don't know, either.)

But it would be strange indeed if it were simultaneously bad epistemic conduct for the claim to appear _earlier_ than its supporting argumentation in a blog post, but acceptable epistemic conduct for the claim to appear _after_ its supporting argumentation in a blog post. It's pretty common for authors to put their thesis statement first! If I wrote a blog post that said, "[Gum stamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postage_stamp_gum) are better than [self-adhesive stamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-adhesive_stamp) because licking things is fun", I doubt Yudkowsky would object and insist that I should have written, "Licking things is fun; therefore, gum stamps are better than self-adhesive stamps." But why would the rules be different when the thesis statement happens to be a claim about an author rather than a claim about stamps?

(I could understand why _humans_ might want rules that treat claims about humans differently from claims about other things. So to clarify, when I ask, "Why would the rules be different?", I'm talking about [the real rules—the epistemic rules](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eY45uCCX7DdwJ4Jha/no-one-can-exempt-you-from-rationality-s-laws).)

"You will find every post of the Less Wrong sequences written the same way," Yudkowsky writes, claiming to have observed his stated principle of good conduct. But if we take "the _Less Wrong_ sequences" to refer to the set of blog posts published by Yudkowsky on _Overcoming Bias_ and _Less Wrong_ between 2006 and 2009, this is false: in a November 2007 post titled ["Beware of Stephen J. Gould"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BahoNzY2pzSeM2Dtk/beware-of-stephen-j-gould),[^sequence-scope] Yudkowsky opens with

> If you've read anything Stephen J. Gould has ever said about evolutionary biology, I have some bad news for you. In the field of evolutionary biology at large, Gould's reputation is mud.

before describing Gould's alleged errors. Moreover, it doesn't seem like it would be easy to rewrite the post to comply with the defer-author-criticism dictum while still accomplishing the aims of the post. The Yudkowsky of 2007 wasn't writing to an audience that already believed Gould's ideas about the complexity of evolved organisms being a random walk and needed to be set straight on that technical point. Rather, Yudkowsky was specifically warning his audience not to trust Stephen Jay Gould in general. Given that purpose, an alleged "basic rule of epistemic conduct" that prevented him from mentioning it in the title and opening paragraph would be obfuscatory, not clarifying.

[^sequence-scope]: "Beware Steven J. Gould" was not included in [a later collection of Yudkowsky's writings from this period](https://www.readthesequences.com/), and is not currently part of a "sequence" as featured in the current _lesswrong.com_ software. One could perhaps argue on those grounds that it should not be construed as part of "the Less Wrong sequences" for the purposes of evaluating the claim that "You will find every post of the Less Wrong sequences written the same way."

I can think of a number of pragmatic reasons why publishing a callout post (such as Omnizoid's denunciation of Yudkowsky or Yudkowsky's denunciation of Gould) might be a bad idea in some specific case, or even in most cases. However, I reject as unfounded the claim that such posts represent an "egregious violation of basic epistemic conduct." I think the _actual_ rules of basic epistemic conduct are things like ["You can't make a fixed conclusion become more correct by arguing for it"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/34XxbRFe54FycoCDw/the-bottom-line) or "[More complicated hypotheses](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Yq6aA4M3JKWaQepPJ/burdensome-details) are [less probable _ex ante_](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mB95aqTSJLNR9YyjH/message-length) and therefore require [more evidence](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nj8JKFoLSMEmD3RGp/how-much-evidence-does-it-take) to [single out for consideration](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/X2AD2LgtKgkRNPj2a/privileging-the-hypothesis)". I'm wary of attempts to conflate human social norms that are [optimized for obfuscating conflicts](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/e4GBj6jxRZcsHFSvP/assume-bad-faith) with the underlying laws of reasoning that [don't themselves dictate any particular rhetorical style](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SX6wQEdGfzz7GKYvp/rationalist-discourse-is-like-physicist-motors).

Having written this post criticizing Yudkowsky's claim about what constitutes a basic rule of epistemic conduct, I suppose I might as well note in passing that if you find my arguments convincing, you should be less inclined to defer to Yudkowsky as an expert on human rationality. But I don't think that should be the main thing readers should take away from this post in the absence of answers to the obvious followup questions: Yudkowsky? Who is that? Why should you care?

I don't know, either.
