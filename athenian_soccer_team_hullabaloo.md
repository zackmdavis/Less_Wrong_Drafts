## Athenian Soccer Team Hullabaloo

> Would you smile to see him dead? Would you say, "We are rid of this obscenist"? Fools! The corpse would laugh at you from its cold eyelids! The motionless lips would mock, and the solemn hands, the pulseless, folded hands, in their quietness would write the last indictment, which neither Time nor you can efface. Kill him! And you write his glory and your shame! Moses Harman in his felon stripes stands far above you now, and Moses Harman _dead_ will live on, immortal in the race he died to free! Kill him!

Call me Xenophon. This is a tribute to my friend and teacher Socrates, the wisest man in Cyber-Athens.

The word choice is deliberate. Socrates is not the most quick-witted, nor the most knowledgable, nor the most savvy. Rather, the nature of his peculiar talent is this: _he knows what he doesn't know._

Most people don't. At least, I don't. All too often, when asked, "Do you get what I'm saying?", I reply, "I think so" with perfect sincerity, only realizing later that [my self-report was false](http://unremediatedgender.space/2016/Sep/psychology-is-about-invalidating-peoples-identities/)—that I could not have paraphrased my interlocutor's ideas, let alone explained why I agreed or disagreed with them. In retrospect (and _only_ in retrospect), it's clear that I didn't want to disrupt the harmonious give-and-take flow of primate social exchange, that I feared being seen as foolish or obstinate for having the temerity to say, "No, I don't understand"—and to continue standing by that _No_ should understanding not be forthcoming.

The unique genius of Socrates is simply that he's not afraid to be seen as foolish or obstinate. If he doesn't understand how you're using a term, he'll ask for a definition. If he doesn't see how to apply your abstract claim, he'll ask for an example. Occasionally it strikes me as a little odd when Socrates asks something that I think he should have been able to figure out by himself.


If I can't explain it to Socrates, I probably don't understand it.


The other year, I got in a slapfight in the cyber-agora with Meletus, the former curriculum director of the Lyceum.

> And this attitude is _particularly_ corrosive to feelings of trust, collaboration, "jamming together," etc. ... it's like walking into a martial arts academy and finding a person present who scoffs at both the instructors and the other students alike, and who doesn't offer sufficient faith to even try a given exercise once before first a) hearing it comprehensively justified and b) checking the sparring records to see if people who did that exercise win more fights.

> But in practice, few people will participate in such a martial arts academy for long, and it’s not true that a martial arts academy lacking that level of rigor makes _no_ progress in discovering and teaching useful things to its students.

This is a remarkably revealing statement.


Kill him! And you write his glory and your shame! Socrates under his rate limits stands far above you now, and Socrates _dead_ will live on, immortal in the race he died to free! Kill him!
