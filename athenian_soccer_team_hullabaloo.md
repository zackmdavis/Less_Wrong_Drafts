## Athenian Soccer Team Hullabaloo

> Would you smile to see him dead? Would you say, "We are rid of this obscenist"? Fools! The corpse would laugh at you from its cold eyelids! The motionless lips would mock, and the solemn hands, the pulseless, folded hands, in their quietness would write the last indictment, which neither Time nor you can efface. Kill him! And you write his glory and your shame! Moses Harman in his felon stripes stands far above you now, and Moses Harman _dead_ will live on, immortal in the race he died to free! Kill him!

Call me Xenophon. This is a tribute to my friend and teacher Socrates, the wisest man in Cyber-Athens.

The word choice is deliberate. Socrates is not the most quick-witted, nor the most knowledgable, nor the most savvy. Rather, the nature of his peculiar talent is this: _he knows what he doesn't know._

Most people don't. At least, I don't. All too often, when asked, "Do you get what I'm saying?", I reply, "I think so" with perfect sincerity, only realizing later that I was deluding myself—that I could not have paraphrased my interlocutor's ideas, let alone explained where I agreed or disagreed with them. In retrospect (and _only_ in retrospect), it's clear that I didn't want to disrupt the harmonious give-and-take flow of primate social exchange, that I feared being seen as foolish or obstinate for having the temerity to say, "No, I don't understand"—and to continue standing by that _No_ should understanding not be forthcoming.

The unique genius of Socrates is simply that he's not afraid to be seen as foolish or obstinate. If he doesn't understand how you're using a term, he'll ask for a definition. If he doesn't see how to apply your abstract claim, he'll ask for an example. If your offered definition or example doesn't make sense to him, he'll say so. _Bluffing doesn't work on him._

Occasionally it strikes me as a little odd when Socrates asks something that I think he should have been able to figure out by himself, but it's no trouble. If I can spare the time, I'm usually happy to type up the requested additional explanation. If I can't spare the time, there's a chance someone else in the cyber-agora might pitch in and supply it.

But if I can spare the time and I can't come up with an explanation that will satisfy Socrates, that's an alarming warning sign that maybe my grasp of the topic isn't as firm as thought: I didn't know what I didn't know.

That's not a hard-and-fast rule that every critical or questioning comment demands a reply. There is such a thing as trolling, and [isolated demands for rigor](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/14/beware-isolated-demands-for-rigor/).

But there's also such a thing as people who combine an above-average need for rigor with a below-average need for social harmony to the result that they can't be bluffed, who are incredibly valuable to have around. Mostly, I figure that if I can't explain it to Socrates, I probably don't understand it.

The other year, I got into an incredibly tedious slapfight in the cyber-agora with Meletus, the former curriculum director of the Lyceum.

> And this attitude is _particularly_ corrosive to feelings of trust, collaboration, "jamming together," etc. ... it's like walking into a martial arts academy and finding a person present who scoffs at both the instructors and the other students alike, and who doesn't offer sufficient faith to even try a given exercise once before first a) hearing it comprehensively justified and b) checking the sparring records to see if people who did that exercise win more fights.

This is a remarkable statement in that, despite taking on the form of a forceful critique of the Socratic method, it's not clear that there's anything here for me or Socrates to substantively disagree with.

Meletus's complaint about the Socratic method is not that it fails to achieve its aims, but that it's _unpopular_ ("few people will participate"). In defense of his own methods, Meletus
