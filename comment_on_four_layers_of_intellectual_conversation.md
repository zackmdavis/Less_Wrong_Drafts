# Comment on "Four Layers of Intellectual Conversation"

One of the most underrated essays in the post-Sequences era of Eliezer Yudkowsky's corpus is ["Four Layers of Intellectual Conversation"](https://archive.ph/Ebgfe). The degree to which this piece of wisdom has fallen into tragic neglect in these dark ages of the 2020s may be related to its idiosyncratic form of publication: it was [originally posted as a status update on Yudkowsky's Facebook account on 20 December 2016](https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10154888183439228) and subsequently mirrored on Alyssa Vance's _The Rationalist Conspiracy_ blog, which has since gone offline. (The first link in this paragraph is to an archive of the _Rationalist Conspiracy_ post.)

In the post, Yudkowsky argues that a structure of intellectual value necessarily requires four layers of conversation: thesis, critique, response, and counter-response (which Yudkowsky [indexes from zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering) as layers 0, 1, 2, and 3).

The importance of critique is already widespread common wisdom: if a thesis is advanced and promulgated without any serious effort to examine why it might be in error, then it likely _is_ in error, both because it can't have incorporated corrections from critiques (which are _ex hypothesi_ absent) and because the author lacks incentives to offer a correct thesis in the first place: if being right is difficult and there's no social penalty for being wrong, then most humans will inexorably find themselves on the easy course of being wrong [even without any conscious intent to deceive](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sXHQ9R5tahiaXEZhR/algorithmic-intent-a-hansonian-generalized-anti-zombie). That is, in the words of the post, the problem with "a conversation consisting of people saying X and nobody saying 'hey maybe not-X'" is that "people could say stupid things about X, and nobody would call them on the stupidity." Yudkowsky aptly concludes: "Yikes!"

Yudkowsky's key observation going beyond common widsom is that the necessity of social incentives to be correct also applies to the level-1 critique and level-2 response, not just the level-0 thesis—and moreover, that the higher levels are critical for the lower levels to maintain their force. The mere existence of level-1 critics won't suffice to keep level-0 thesis-proposers on their toes, if the level-1 critics are themselves not on their toes because they don't anticipate being held to account by level-2 responses. Likewise, level-2 responses won't suffice to keep level-1 critics on their toes if the level-2 responders don't anticipate being held to account by level-3 counter-responses. Without all four levels, the whole stucture comes apart.

Yudkowsky offers public debates about evolution and molecular nanotechnology as examples of discourses with a missing level 3. If biologists explain evolution (level-0 thesis), religious scholars insist that God must have started it all (level-1 critique), biologists explain leading theories of [abiogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis) (level-2 response), but religious scholars don't engage with the abiogenesis work, then the conversation has failed to secure a level-3 counter-response.

Likewise if K. Eric Drexler writes technical books and papers about the possibilities of nanotechnology (level-0 thesis), [**TODO RESEARCH**: does the Drexler-Smalley debate actually fit this pattern? We can't just take Yudkowsky's word for it! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drexler%E2%80%93Smalley_debate_on_molecular_nanotechnology But Yudkowsky also says that the levels have to be "impressive" not merely present; if I'm not taking Yudkowsky's word for it, I don't have the chemistry chops myself to tell if Smalley is bluffing.]

[**TODO**: other examples?? Bailey _vs._ Moser on AGP in cis women (or just Bailey _vs._ anyone, like Veale) is what comes to mind, but I don't want to use that example on _Less Wrong_.]

[**TODO**: both of Yudkowsky's concrete examples (evolution, nano; "academic journals don't do this" isn't concrete enough) feature the side Yudkowsky agrees with as the level-0 thesis-proposers, but if this is really a general framework for making sense of debates, there should be incorrect level-0 theses. There should also be examples of _successful_ four-levels! Meta note: there are both really obvious criticisms of the post as written, if you're thinking seriously about it, but almost none of the people who made drive-by comments on Facebook in 2016 were spending hours thinking about it and trying to generate these—and the degraded Yudkowsky of 2016 wouldn't have wanted them to, because that would be annoying.]

[**TODO**: ChatGPT o3 suggests the replication crisis as a potential successful four-levels. I think the idea that there was a replication crisis is mainstream now! How did that happen? https://chatgpt.com/share/687722d5-f9d0-8005-b290-6e9a21c4bc57 ]

[**TODO**: summarize Yudkowsky on academic journals only canonizing 0–2. The four-level framework implies that the real work is happening elsewhere, in backroom conversations; the glory of old email lists]

A natural question to ask about the four-levels framework is: why four levels, specifically? Doesn't the recursion of level _n_ needing level _n_ + 1 go off to infinity?

The original post leaves the question unanswered, but a potential answer can be found in Yudkowsky's tongue-in-cheek Law of Ultrafinite Recursion, which states that, in practice, infinite recursions are at most three levels deep. The Law of Ultrafinite Recursion is deliberately silly if construed as a literal claim about computer science, but is surprisingly fruitful as a claim about human psychology: it's pretty natural to ask what Alice thinks that Bob thinks about Carol, but asking what Alice thinks that Bob thinks that Carol thinks about Dave feels like a stretch.

If the limited human grasp of recursion rounds "four" up to "infinity", then the chain of thesis–critique–response–counter-response is enough to establish the expectation of unlimited-depth accountability and remove the incentive to bluff. A different species with greater working memory capacity, whose members could follow a backwards induction farther, might need more counter-counter-responses and counter-counter-counter-responses to experience the same salutary effect.

[**TODO**—

The four-levels model is about robust disagreements. Both sides probably think the other side is annoying, but if one of them has mod power to silence the other, then you don't get the four levels of mutual recursive pressure. The Smalley–Drexler debate worked, to the extent that it did work, because the journal was willing to let both of them talk.

["The Importance of Less Wrong, or Another Single Conversational Locus"](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/8rYxw9xZfwy86jkpG/on-the-importance-of-less-wrong-or-another-single) can only work if LW tolerates robust disagreement. Otherwise it's an institution like Catholicism that can stay stuck in its own level-0 indefinitely.
