## Contra Yudkowsky on Epistemic Conduct for Author Criticism

In [a comment on the Effective Altruism Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZS9GDsBtWJMDEyFXh/eliezer-yudkowsky-is-frequently-confidently-egregiously?commentId=7fs5nHEkK6AGgPAJ9) responding to Omnizoid's ["Eliezer Yudkowsky Is Frequently, Confidently, Egregiously Wrong"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TjyyngWFYvQWPpNNj/eliezer-yudkowsky-is-frequently-confidently-egregiously), Eliezer Yudkowsky writes:

> You will mark that in this comment I first respond to a substantive point and show it to be mistaken before I make any general criticism of the author; which can then be supported by that previously shown, initial, first-thing, object-level point. You will find every post of the Less Wrong sequences written the same way.

> As the entire post violates basic rules of epistemic conduct by opening with a series of not-yet-supported personal attacks, I will not be responding to the rest in detail. I'm sad about how anything containing such an egregious violation of basic epistemic conduct got this upvoted, and wonder about sockpuppet accounts or alternatively a downfall of EA. The relevant principle of epistemic good conduct seems to me straightforward: if you've got to make personal attacks (and sometimes you do), make them _after_ presenting your object-level points that support those personal attacks. This shouldn't be a difficult rule to follow, or follow much better than this; and violating it this hugely and explicitly is sufficiently bad news that people should've been wary about this post and hesitated to upvote it for that reason alone.

I agree that the dictum to refute an author's arguments before commenting on their character or authority is good writing advice, which I generally endeavor to follow. However, I argue that Yudkowsky errs in characterizing it as a "basic rule[ ] of epistemic conduct."

It seems to me that the reason "refutation first, character attacks only afterwards (if at all)" is good writing advice is because it guards against the all-too-human failure mode of previously intellectually fruitful conversations degenerating into _ad hominem_ and name-calling, which are not intellectually fruitful.

When I'm debating someone about some subject of broader interest to the world—for example, stamp collecting—I want to keep the conversation's focus on the subject of interest. If my interlocutor is untrustworthy, it might be worth arguing that to the audience in order to help them not be misled by my interlocutor's false claims about the subject of interest. But the relevance of the character claim to the debate needs to be clearly established. The mere truth of the claim "My interlocutor is untrustworthy" is no defense if the claim is _off-topic_ (because [argument screens off authority](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5yFRd3cjLpm3Nd6Di/argument-screens-off-authority)). The audience doesn't care about either of us. They want to hear about the stamps!

(This is probably not the _only_ reason to avoid personal attacks, but I think it's the important one.)

However, sometimes the character or authority of an author _is_ the subject of interest. This is clearly the case for Omnizoid's post. The post is not a derailment of already ongoing discussions of epiphenominalism, decision theory, and animal consciousness. Rather, the central thesis that Omnizoid is trying to convince readers of is that Yudkowsky is frequently, confidently, egregiously wrong. The aim of the article (as Omnizoid explains in the paragraphs beginning with "The aim of this article [...]") is to discourage readers from deferring to Yudkowsky as an authority figure. 

"Eliezer Yudkowsky is frequently, confidently, egregiously wrong" is a testable claim about the real world. It might be a claim of less broad interest to Society than the questions debated by students of decision theory, animal consciousness, or stamp collecting. (If someone told you that Mortimer Q. Snodgrass is frequently, confidently, egregiously wrong, you would ask, "Who is that? Why should I care?" I don't know, either.) Nevertheless, it is a claim that someone apparently found worthwhile to write a blog post about, and fair-minded readers should hold that post to the same standards as they would a post on any other testable claim about the real world.

Yudkowsky condemns Omnizoid's post as "violat[ing] basic rules of epistemic conduct by opening with a series of not-yet-supported personal attacks", citing an alleged "principle of epistemic good conduct" that personal attacks must be made "_after_ presenting your object-level points that support those personal attacks." The conduct complaint seems to be not that Omnizoid fails to argue for his thesis, nor that the arguments are bad, but merely that the arguments appear later in the post. Yudkowsky's language seems unambiguous on this point, writing "not-yet-supported", rather than "unsupported" or "poorly supported".

But this is, frankly, bizarre. It's pretty common for authors to put the thesis statement first! If I wrote a blog post that said, "[Gum stamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postage_stamp_gum) are better than [self-adhesive stamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-adhesive_stamp); this is because licking things is fun", I doubt Yudkowsky would object and insist that I should have written, "Licking things is fun; therefore, gum stamps are better than self-adhesive stamps." But why would the rules be different when the thesis statement happens to be a claim about an author rather than a claim about stamps?

(I could understand why [_humans_ might want rules that treat claims about humans differently from claims about other things](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h2Hk2c2Gp5sY4abQh/lack-of-social-grace-is-an-epistemic-virtue). So to clarify, when I ask, "Why would the rules be different?", I'm talking about [the real rules—the epistemic rules](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eY45uCCX7DdwJ4Jha/no-one-can-exempt-you-from-rationality-s-laws).)

"You will find every post of the Less Wrong sequences written the same way," Yudkowsky writes, claiming to have observed his stated principle of good conduct. But this claim is potentially falsified by a November 2007 post by Yudkowsky titled ["Beware of Stephen J. Gould"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BahoNzY2pzSeM2Dtk/beware-of-stephen-j-gould),[^sequence-scope] which opens with

> If you've read anything Stephen J. Gould has ever said about evolutionary biology, I have some bad news for you. In the field of evolutionary biology at large, Gould's reputation is mud.

before describing Gould's alleged errors.

[^sequence-scope]: I say only "potentially" falsified, because "Beware Steven J. Gould" was not included in [a later collection of Yudkowsky's writings from this period](https://www.readthesequences.com/), and is not currently part of a "sequence" in the current _lesswrong.com_ software; one could perhaps argue on those grounds that it should not be construed as part of "the Less Wrong sequences" for the purposes of evaluating the claim that "You will find every post of the Less Wrong sequences written the same way."

Indeed, "Beware of Stephen J. Gould" would seem to have essentially the same argument structure as "Eliezer Yudkowsky Is Frequently, Confidently, Egregiously Wrong".

In the former, Yudkowsky argues that readers should distrust Stephen Jay Gould on the grounds that Gould is not only wrong, but misrepresents the consensus of relevant academic experts. ("Gould systematically misrepresented what other scientists thought; he deluded the public as to what evolutionary biologists were thinking.")

In the latter, Omnizoid argues that readers should distrust Eliezer Yudkowsky on the grounds that Yudkowsky is not only wrong, but misrepresents the consensus of relevant academic experts. ("Eliezer's own source that he links to to describe how unstrawmanny it is shows that it is a strawman" [...] "Eliezer admits that he has not so much as read the arguments people give" [...] "If you're reading something by Eliezer and it seems too obvious, on a controversial issue, there's a decent chance you are being duped.")

It's hard to see how "Eliezer Yudkowsky Is Frequently, Confidently, Egregiously Wrong" could be in "egregious violation of basic epistemic conduct" while "Beware of Stephen J. Gould" is not. (One might find Yudkowsky's arguments contra Gould more compelling on the object level than Omnizoid's arguments contra Yudkowsky, but that [would seem to be irrelevant insofar as](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WQFioaudEH8R7fyhm/local-validity-as-a-key-to-sanity-and-civilization) the "epistemic conduct" allegation is about form rather than correctness.)

To be clear, this is not necessarily to accuse Yudkowsky of hypocrisy. "Beware of Stephen J. Gould" was written over fifteen years ago. People can change a lot over fifteen years! (Not always for the better.)

[TODO:

 * maybe he regrets the anti-Gould post—it would certainly be possible to be rewritten as "Evolutionary Complexity Is Not a Random Walk", and only say "and this shows that Gould is bad" at the end. But that would have been obfuscatory. The real reason he wrote the post was to warn people against Gould; the constraint of not being allowed to mention that in the title or first paragraph is obfuscatory.

 * Why am I bothering to nitpick this? The reason this matters is because the world "epistemic" means something (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/epistemic, "Of or relating to cognition or knowledge, its scope, or how it is acquired."); it's not just a verbal tic that you can throw in front of anything to indicate approval of your internet cult. If you call something an epistemic conduct violation, you should be able to explain how the violation leads to maps failing to reflect territory.

]

Moreover, it doesn't seem like it would be easy to rewrite the post to comply with the defer-author-criticism dictum while still accomplishing the aims of the post. The Yudkowsky of 2007 wasn't writing to an audience that already believed Gould's ideas about the complexity of evolved organisms being a random walk and needed to be set straight on that technical point. Rather, Yudkowsky was specifically warning his audience not to trust Stephen Jay Gould in general. Given that purpose, an alleged "basic rule of epistemic conduct" that prevented him from mentioning it in the title and opening paragraph would be obfuscatory, not clarifying.

I can think of a number of pragmatic reasons why publishing a callout post (such as Omnizoid's denunciation of Yudkowsky, or Yudkowsky's denunciation of Gould) might be a bad idea in some specific case, or even in most cases.

However, I reject as unfounded the claim that such posts represent an "egregious violation of basic epistemic conduct."

I think the _actual_ rules of basic epistemic conduct are things like ["You can't make a fixed conclusion become more correct by arguing for it"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/34XxbRFe54FycoCDw/the-bottom-line) or "[More complicated hypotheses](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Yq6aA4M3JKWaQepPJ/burdensome-details) are [less probable _ex ante_](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mB95aqTSJLNR9YyjH/message-length) and therefore require [more evidence](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nj8JKFoLSMEmD3RGp/how-much-evidence-does-it-take) to [single out for consideration](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/X2AD2LgtKgkRNPj2a/privileging-the-hypothesis)". I'm wary of attempts to conflate human social norms that are [optimized for obfuscating conflicts](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/e4GBj6jxRZcsHFSvP/assume-bad-faith) with the underlying laws of reasoning that [don't themselves dictate any particular rhetorical style](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SX6wQEdGfzz7GKYvp/rationalist-discourse-is-like-physicist-motors).

Having written this post criticizing Yudkowsky's claim about what constitutes a basic rule of epistemic conduct, I suppose I might as well note in passing that if you find my arguments convincing, you should [to some degree](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/627DZcvme7nLDrbZu/update-yourself-incrementally) be less inclined to defer to Yudkowsky as an expert on human rationality. But I don't think that should be the main thing readers should take away from this post in the absence of answers to the obvious followup questions: Yudkowsky? Who is that? Why should you care?

I don't know, either.
