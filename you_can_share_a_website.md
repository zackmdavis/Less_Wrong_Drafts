# You Can Share a Website With People Who Aren't Optimizing the Same Thing as You


[In a 17 April 2023 preliminary verdict](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9DhneE5BRGaCS2Cja/moderation-notes-re-recent-said-duncan-threads?commentId=8qsAJFiB5rJg7aoJ9), _Less Wrong_ moderator Raymond Arnold temporarily banned two users pending negotiation of agreements in which they "credibly commit to changing their behavior in a fairly significant way; or, accept some kind of tech solution that limits their engagement in some reliable way that doesn't depend on their continued behavior; or, be banned from commenting on other people's posts."

In this post, I will argue that this is an bad ruling for reasons that don't depend much on the specifics of the users in question. (Both users have many highly-upvoted contributions and are unambiguously not trolls or spammers; the arguments in this post don't depend on more than that.) I urge Arnold to reconsider his decision in the strongest possible terms.

> both have a very strong principled sense of what a 'good' LessWrong would look like and are optimizing pretty hard for that within whatever constraints we give them

> both trying pretty hard to be good citizen in another country that the LessWrong team is consciously not trying to be. It's hard to build good rules/guidelines that actually robustly deal with that kind of optimization.

> “make it such that Said and Duncan either have actively (credibly) agreed to stop optimizing in a fairly deep way, or, are somehow limited by site tech such that they can’t do the cluster of things they want to do that feels damaging to me.”


### Judges Are Not Optimizers

In ["Free to Optimize"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EZ8GniEPSechjDYP9/free-to-optimize), Eliezer Yudkowsky claims that the function of the legal system is "to provide a _predictable environment_ in which people can optimize their _own_ futures." That is, in the common law tradition, it's not within the purview of the legal system to dictate how citizens speak to each other, what professions they pursue, or what clothes they wear. The role of the legal system is to prevent crimes, so that people can make these choices for themselves in peace and security—even at the risk of some people making foolish choices. In a free country (as contrasted to an authoritarian dictatorship), a good citizen is someone who pays their taxes and doesn't commit crimes.

To be sure, web forums and countries are very different. However, I argue that the analogy is fruitful. _Less Wrong_'s mission of advancing the art of human rationality is a very broad one, [the common interest of many causes](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4PPE6D635iBcGPGRy/rationality-common-interest-of-many-causes).

If _Less Wrong_ is a [garden to be well-kept](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tscc3e5eujrsEeFN4/well-kept-gardens-die-by-pacifism), it's a garden in a public park.
