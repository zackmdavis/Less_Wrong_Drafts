## "You'll Never Persuade People Like That"

Sometimes, when someone is arguing for some proposition, their interlocutor will reply that the speaker's choice of arguments or tone won't be effective at persuading some third party.

This would seem to be an odd change of topic. I was arguing that this-and-such proposition is _actually true_. Whether or not my arguments would persuade some third party who _isn't here_, is a _separate question_.

What's going on in this kind of situation? Why would someone think "You'll never persuade people like that" was a relevant reply?

"Because people aren't truthseeking and treat arguments as soldiers" doesn't seem like an adequate explanation by itself. It's true, but it's not specific enough: what particularly makes appeal-to-persuading-third-parties an effective "soldier"?

The [bargaining model of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bargaining_model_of_war) attempts to explain why wars are fought—and _not_ fought; even the bitterest enemies often prefer to grudgingly make peace with each other rather than continue to fight.

That's because war is costly. If I estimate that by continuing to wage war, there's a 60% chance my armies will hold a desirable piece of territory, I can achieve my war objectives equally well [in expectation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value)—while saving a lot of money and human lives—by instead signing a peace treaty that divides the territory with the enemy 60/40.

If the enemy will agree to that, of course. The enemy has their own forecast probabilities and their own war objectives. There's usually a range of possible treaties that both parties will prefer to fighting, but the parties need to negotiate to select a particular treaty, because there's no uniquely obvious "fair" treaty—similar to how a buyer and seller need to negotiate a price for a rare and expensive item for which there is no uniquely obvious "fair" price.

If [war is bargaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bargaining_model_of_war), and arguments are soldiers, then debate is negotiation.


Thomas Schelling teaches us that 


Wilhelm—
> "you are starting to persuade me, or you might be persuade others, and I don't want you to do that because I am in cognitive dissonance or have pre-existing commitments that are counter to your perspective"

> if A is talking to B, and then B starts telling A what he needs to do to be more persuasive to C, this is logical rudeness, unless A accepts the premise that the goal is to persuade C

> what's really going on in the ABC scenario is that B is uncomfortable with A's claims due to cognitive dissonance, but doesn't have an immediate rebuttal to provide, so he launders his discomfort by saying that C would not be persuaded

non-truthseeking conversation as a negotiation
move the locus of negotiation elsewhere

angelic irony response: persuasion is anti-social
straightforward response: this post

 I'm trying to say what I actually think and feel in clear language! Whether other people are persuaded by this is their business, not mine!
