# Lack of Social Grace Is an Epistemic Virtue

Someone once told me that they thought I acted like refusing to employ the bare minimum of social grace was a virtue, and that this was bad. (I'm paraphrasing; they actually used a different word that starts with _b_.)

I definitely don't want to say that lack of social grace is _unambiguously_ a virtue. Humans are social animals, so the set of human virtues is almost certainly going to involve doing social things gracefully!

Nevertheless, I think I will bite the bullet on a weaker claim. Politeness is, to a large extent, about concealing or obsfuscating information that someone would prefer not to be revealed. (That's why someone might say in response to a compliment, "Do you really mean it, or are you just being polite?") Idealized honest Bayesian reasoners would not have social graces—and therefore, humans trying to imitate idealized honest Bayesian reasoners will tend to bump up against or smash through the bare minimum of social graces. In this sense, we might say that the lack of social graces is an "epistemic" virtue.

Let me illustrate what I mean with one fictional and one real-life example.

In the beginning of the film _The Invention of Lying_ (before the eponymous invention of lying), we see a depiction of an alternate world in which everyone is [radically honest](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GMhzDb3uAFYLwmXtY/radical-honesty)—not just in [the narrow sense of not lying](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MN4NRkMw7ggt9587K/firming-up-not-lying-around-its-edge-cases-is-less-broadly), but in 



In one scene, our everyman protagonist is on a date at a restaurant with an attractive woman.

"I'm very embarrassed I work here," says the waiter. "And you're very pretty," he tells the woman. "That only makes this worse."

"Your sister?" the waiter asks our protagonist.

"No," says our everyman.

"Daughter?"

"No."

"She's way out of your league."

"... thank you."

The woman's phone rings. She explains that it's her mother, probably calling to check on the date, 

(still at the table, with our protagonist hearing every word).

"Hello?" she answers the phone. "Yes, I'm with him right now. ... No, not very attractive ... No, doesn't make much money. It's alright, though, seems nice, kind of funny. ... A bit fat. ... Has a funny little—snub nose, kind of like a frog in the—facial ... No, I won't be sleeping with him tonight. ... No, probably not even a kiss. ... Okay, you too, 'bye."
