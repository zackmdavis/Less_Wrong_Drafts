# Violencia's Testimony at the Trial of Vigilantus

_[A courtroom in days of yore. The defendant **Vigilantus** stands stage left inside an iron cage; he is on trial for defaming Duke Imperion. Vigilantus's friend **Violencia** waits stage right at the front of the galley; the offending remarks were spoken in her presence and she has been summoned to testify against Vigilantus. The Lord Magistrate **Placatio** presides over the Court, aided by his **Clerk**.]_

**Violencia**: [_whispering to herself_] [Go, Soul, the body's guest, upon a thankless errand. Fear not to touch the best, the truth shall be thy warrant. Go, since I needs must dieâ€”](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/trb9HPWFk8Gy9MBdN/less-wrong-poetry-corner-walter-raleigh-s-the-lie)

**Clerk**: Call Violencia of Rosevale. Stand forth and take the oath.

_[She rises and walks to the stand.]_

**Clerk**: You shall true answer make to all such questions as this Court shall demand of you, and the evidence you shall give to this Court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. So help you God.

**Violencia**: So help me God.

**Placatio**: Wast thou at the Rose Garden Tavern on the eve of St. Barnabas last?

**Violencia**: I was, my Lord.

**Placatio**: Didst thou see the prisoner there?

**Violencia**: I did, my Lord.

**Placatio**: And didst thou there hear the prisoner disparage the honor of His Grace, Lord Imperion?

**Violencia**: No, my Lord.

**Placatio**: _[annoyed]_ Woman, I remind thee that thou art under oath. Didst thou or didst thou not hear the prisoner speak of His Grace, Lord Imperion?

**Violencia**: I did, my Lord.

**Placatio**: Thy testimony contradicts itself: first thou deniest hearing the prisoner disparage the Duke's honor, now thou affirmest it.

**Violencia**: No, my Lord. I affirm that I heard Vigilantus speak of the Duke. I deny that what I heard was dispargement.

**Placatio**: Tell the Court what words thy didst hear.

**Violencia**: I had just mentioned that the price of soap had trebled at market. Vigilantus said it was probably due to a charter of monopoly on soap recently announced by His Grace Lord Imperion. He said that the announcement had proclaimed that the charter would guarantee the finest quality soap to people of the realm. Then he observed that the company granted the monopoly is owned by the Duke's cousin.

**Placatio**: So he did disparage the honor of the Duke.

**Violencia**: No, my Lord. Vigilantus said nothing of honor. He spoke only of facts. The text of the announcement of the monopoly is a matter of public record. If it please my Lordship, he could check and see that Vigilantus spoke truth. Similarly the ownership of the Rose Valley Soap Company, and the owner's relation to the Duke, are both well-known in the realm.

**Placatio**: The disparagement is implied.

**Violencia**: How, my Lord?

**Placatio**: _[he seems to think about it for a few moments, then]_ Thou dost not ask the questions in this courtoom!

_[**Placatio** makes a sudden movement as if to dismiss Violencia, then stops. He looks deep in thought, as if realizing that he does not yet have the evidence to lawfully convict Vigilantus.]_

**Placatio**: Then what did he say?

**Violencia**: That's all, my Lord. 

**Placatio**: What of his tone? Did he sound scornful, did he sneer?

**Violencia**: Not to my ears, my Lord.







**Placatio**: Didst thou just call me "thou"?

**Violencia**: No, my Lord.
