## Assume Bad Faith

I've been trying to avoid the terms "good faith" and "bad faith". I'm suspicious that most people who have picked up the phrase "bad faith" from hearing it used, don't actually know what it means—and maybe, that the thing it does mean doesn't [carve reality at the joints](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/esRZaPXSHgWzyB2NL/where-to-draw-the-boundaries).

People get very touchy about "bad faith" accusations: they think that you should assume good faith, but that if you've determined someone is in bad faith, you shouldn't even be talking to them, that you need to exile them.

What does "bad faith" _mean_, though?


 * Bad faith doesn't mean "with ill intent"; it means the apparent motives aren't the real motives
 * The problem: hidden motives are ubiquitous in human life!! A world without them would be incredibly alien. X isn't about Y.
 * And so, "Be very reluctant to accuse people of bad faith, and cut off contact with them if you think they are" isn't practicable, becasuse I don't trust _anyone_ in that way, not even myself.
 * In particular, people seem to believe that persistent "good faith" disagreements are a thing: that we can both be honest seekers of truth, and still end up persistently disagreeing
 * Actual good faith disagreements (where you're both just trying to get to the truth, and there are no other hidden motives, no _something else_ going on) tend not to persist!
 * Example 1: I ask you if it's going to rain. You say, "Yes, I read the weather report". I _immediately_ replace my belief with yours.
 * Example 2: We're both trying to calculate something, and we get different answers. If I think we're both equally good calculators, I don't feel particularly attached to the belief that my answer is right.
 * Most disagreements of note—most disagreements that people _care about_—don't look like this, from which we can infer that there is "something else" going on than just trying to get the facts
 * Even if everything you say is true, that doesn't save you from "something else" going on—you're probably selecting the facts to advance your interests
 * But admitting that you're doing that isn't part of the game! The universal practice is to come up with arguments to persuade the other guy why it's in _his_ interests to do the thing that you want
 * Inferential distance isn't a compelling explanation: in the case of the disagreeing mathematicians, you tend to assign a large probability that the other guy is right, even if you don't see how they got it.
 * Some might say: bad faith is about "intent", an "honest bias" isn't bad faith
 * From the standpoint of information transfer, the difference between bias and deception is _uninteresting_. If the apple is green, and you tell me it's red and I believe you, I end up with false beliefs about the apple. It _doesn't matter_ whether you said it was red because you were lying or because you're wearing rose-colored glasses; the input–output function is the same
 * At best, conscious deception is worse than bias because it offers much more resistance: someone who's merely biased will fold when presented with a compelling argument, someone's who's consciously lying will _keep_ lying until you catch them red-handed in front of an audience with power over them
 * Given that there's usually "something else" going on, how do we go on?
 * Two strategies: stick to the object-level arguments, and full-contact psychoanalysis.
 * In most cases, I _prefer_ to stick to the object-level: just engage with the text of what people said, without addressing what you think their angle is in saying it.
 * This is the main benefit of "assume good faith" norms, but a crucial difference is that you should _not_ be assuming good faith, and you should have to pretend that you are, either: just—address the text! It's not that you shouldn't suspect hidden motives, it's that those are _off-topic_.
 * The other alternative is full-on cards-on-the-table conflict-theory psychologizing. Done well, it looks like a negotiation.
 * Ironically, the strategy that corresponds to "assume good faith" is actually less honest than admitting that the disagreement is actually a negotiation
