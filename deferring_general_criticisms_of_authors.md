## Deferring General Criticism of Authors Is Not a Basic Rule of Epistemic Conduct

In [a comment on the Effective Altruism Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZS9GDsBtWJMDEyFXh/eliezer-yudkowsky-is-frequently-confidently-egregiously?commentId=7fs5nHEkK6AGgPAJ9) responding to ["Eliezer Yudkowsky Is Frequently, Confidently, Egregiously Wrong"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TjyyngWFYvQWPpNNj/eliezer-yudkowsky-is-frequently-confidently-egregiously), Eliezer Yudkowsky writes:

> You will mark that in this comment I first respond to a substantive point and show it to be mistaken before I make any general criticism of the author; which can then be supported by that previously shown, initial, first-thing, object-level point. You will find every post of the Less Wrong sequences written the same way.

> As the entire post violates basic rules of epistemic conduct by opening with a series of not-yet-supported personal attacks, I will not be responding to the rest in detail. I'm sad about how anything containing such an egregious violation of basic epistemic conduct got this upvoted, and wonder about sockpuppet accounts or alternatively a downfall of EA. The relevant principle of epistemic good conduct seems to me straightforward: if you've got to make personal attacks (and sometimes you do), make them _after_ presenting your object-level points that support those personal attacks. This shouldn't be a difficult rule to follow, or follow much better than this; and violating it this hugely and explicitly is sufficiently bad news that people should've been wary about this post and hesitated to upvote it for that reason alone.

I agree that the dictum to refute an author's arguments before commenting on their character or authority is good writing advice, which I generally endeavor to follow. However, I argue that Yudkowsky errs in characterizing it as a "basic rule[ ] of epistemic conduct."

It seems to me that the reason "refutation first, character attacks only afterwards (if at all)" is good writing advice is because it guards against the all-too-human failure mode of previously intellectually fruitful conversations degenerating into _ad hominem_ and name-calling, which are not intellectually fruitful.

When I'm debating someone about some subject of broader interest to the world (like stamp collecting or AI alignment), I want to keep the focus on the subject of interest. If my interlocutor is untrustworthy, it might be worth arguing that to the audience in order to help them not be misled by my interlocutor's false claims about the subject of interest—but the relevance of the character claim to the debate needs to be clearly established. The truth of the claim "My interlocutor is untrustworthy" is no defense if the claim is _off-topic_ (because [argument screens off authority](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5yFRd3cjLpm3Nd6Di/argument-screens-off-authority)). The audience doesn't care about either of you. They want to hear about the stamps!

(This is probably not the _only_ reason to avoid personal attacks, but I think it's the important one.)

[TODO—
 * sometimes a person is the subject of interest, as in this case
 * the claim that the Sequences are written this way is false, as evidenced by the Steven J. Gould post (which is analogous)
 * writing the Gould post to comply with the dictum would be bad
 * you shouldn't call something a violation of "basic epistemic conduct" if you can't describe what's factually wrong with the pattern of inference (separately from whether it's a good norm for humans) That's not dignified!!
